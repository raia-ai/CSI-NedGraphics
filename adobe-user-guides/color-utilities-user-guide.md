The Color Range tool is a great for creating digital colors that match to your printer’s
calibration. In turn, helping you to achieve a more accurate representation of the colors used
in your artwork. You can access the Color Range Module by clicking on the          icon in the
Design Bar or by going to Window > NedGraphics > Color Range.

The first place you can start with matching color is under the Books Tab. It is a fast way of
generating a robust spectrum of colors to print out and have on hand to match your physical
color chips to. The Color Book is meant to only be a starter in matching your colors by
getting you a broad range of color to work towards an approximate match.




To make a Color Book, click the
Books Tab on the Color Range
module. Choose between RGB or
CMYK in the Color Mode drop-
down menu and then type in
the number of pages you’d like
to print, as well as the number
of chips you’d like to print
horizontally and vertically on each
page. Then, press “Generate”.

A new document will be created
with multiple art boards. The
length of time it takes to generate
the book will depend on how
many pages and chips you’ve
indicated to place horizontally
and vertically. The larger the
number, the longer it will take to
generate. Looking closer at the
pages created in the Color Book,
you will find either RGB or CMYK
values printed above each chip.
If you check the Hex option, it
will place the color Hex code
above each chip. The Illustrator
document mode will still be
determined by CMYK or RGB.

The Range Tab will allow you to create a range of colors based off of the current Fill color.
Once you have the color you’d like to create a range from in your Fill Box, click the “Add”
button at the top of the Range Tab window. This will place the properties of the color into
the color mode sliders of the Range Tab.

                                         Next go to the bottom of the tool and specify the quantity
                                         of color chips, the desired Step Size and Value Mode.




Hit the “Generate” button. This will create a new document with the chosen number of chips
that are the specified “Step” away from the original color chip.

The Step size determines how far away the range of new colors will be from the original Fill
color that was added to the Color Range Tool. Selecting “1” will result in a range of colors
that are very close to your original Fill color, while “10” would result in a range that is very far
away from your original Fill color. After you have generated your range, you can change your
Step size at any time and the document will automatically be updated.

The HSB Separation Section will allow you to filter the
colors created in the range by Hue, Saturation, and/or
Brightness. You can choose any combination of the 3
options by checking and unchecking the boxes. When
checking and unchecking these options, be careful to
always leave one option checked before unchecking.
If all three options are unchecked at the same time,
the document will not display any of the ranges and
just become a blank document. You will have to hit the
Generate button again to start over.

Throughout all of the NedGraphics For Adobe modules you will come across a common tab
called “Layout.” The Layout Tab will always be an option for you to edit and adjust the chip
sizes and how they are formatted for in the document. In the Color Range module, you can
use the Layout Tab to change your chip sizes to fit on a specific page.




As you change the fields in the Color Range Tool, your document will automatically update to
the new settings you selected. You can change the Step size and Quantity if you think you’ll
need to print more or less options than what was first generated. You can also manually
adjust the color by using the sliders or by typing in a new RGB number. Your main chip at
the top of the range will change as you adjust the color and new ranges will be created in
the same document. So you can print off multiple ranges for your entire palette from one
document. Plus, the document will automatically add and subtract art boards as you change
the quantity of chips in your color range.




You can adjust the page size your range will print on in the Page Settings Section of the
Layout Tab. In the Size drop-down menu we have standard page sizes for you to select. If
you are printing on a custom sheet of paper or a plotter, you can manually enter in the Width
and Height of your page and change the unit of measurement if needed in the Units drop-
down menu. If you’d like to add a custom logo to each printout, click the Set Logo button
and navigate to the logo file you’d like to place on the page.

Changing the Quantity to 84 chips at default size will create two art boards. If you would
like to print 84 chips on a single sheet of letter-sized paper, you can go to the Layout Tab
and select a smaller height and width in the Chips section. The V gap & H gap sections will
increase or decrease the space between each chip.

The last feature in the Color Range Module gives you the option to match any color to
an existing swatch in a Swatch Library, including Pantone libraries. To match a color to
a Pantone or custom library, first, open up the library you would like to use. Open your
Swatches (Window > Swatches) and then click on the Swatch Option button in the upper
right corner of the Window. Scroll down to “Open Swatch Library” and navigate to the
Pantone Library you wish to match to. In this case, we are using Pantone+ Solid Coated.

                                            After opening a swatch library, use the eye dropper tool
                                            to select the color you wish to match to a color in the
                                            open Swatch Library. Once that color is in your Fill box,
                                            press the “Match” button in the Match Tab.




 The color in the Swatch Library that is
closest to the color in the Fill box will
automatically place itself in the main Swatch
Library. If there are multiple swatch libraries
open, it will match to the library that is on
top or was last opened and selected.

provider, color code, and other can be used for
Pantone matching, other color profile codes, etc.

                 PALETTE MANAGER TIPS & TRICKS
1. Do not use spaces when entering a name in the Brand/Year/ Palette fields. Use periods,
       dashes, or underscores instead for separation.
2. You can switch between palettes any time by using the drop-down arrows next to the 		
       section you to move to.
3. You can add colors at anytime to existing palettes.
4. Make sure you do not have anything selected in the document when adding a new color.
       The color that is added to the library comes from whatever is in your fill box.
5. These palettes can be used in all artwork and will work in
conjunction with Palette Utility and Color Cards Manager.

To get started, create a new blank document and open the Color Cards window by clicking
on the      button on the Design Bar.

You can open a template for your color card or create a new layout from scratch. To create
a new one, type in the Title and Delivery information for this palette and hit the “+” button to
add it to the page

                                            If you’re not using a template, start by typing in the
                                            title of the color card, along with the name of the
                                            delivery season. Then, click the “+” button to create
                                            the beginnings of your color card.

                                            Once a card template is on your page, The default
                                            label in the Section portion will be called “Main.” To
                                            change it, highlight the world “Main” and type in the
                                            name for the Section that you want. Hit the pencil
                                            button to change it. You will get a pop-up window that
                                            looks like this:

                                            Add additional sections
                                            by typing in the desired
                                            section name and
                                            clicking the “+” button.


Below is an example of the document that Color Cards creates when you have added a Title,
Delivery and two different Sections.

                                                            You can delete a Section just like the
                                                            Delivery Field, by bringing it up in the Drop-

                                                            is a section called Templates. To save your

                                                            button. Whatever has been added to your

To add colors to your color card, bring up the color palette you’ve built in Palette Manager, by
using the drop-down menus in the Palettes tab at the bottom of the Color Card window.

                                                                                           For a color card with

                           Add multiple colors to a palette by selecting each one while
                           holding “cmd” (mac) OR “ctrl” (PC) on your keyboard. You can
                           rearrange the order the colors are listed by selecting a color and
                           clicking the up arrow button or the down arrow button. You can
                           delete a color from the list by selecting it and pressing the “X”
                           button. If you’d like to add a color from your Swatch Library,
                           select those colors and then press the “+” button.

The Page tab will give you the options to manage what your color card will look like. Set the
Page Size with the drop-down arrows next to the Size option, or you can type in a your page
dimensions if you do not use common paper sizes. You can change the unit of measurement
for the page by using the drop- down menu in the Units option. If you’d like to flip your page
from portrait to landscape, click the button. You can change the font used for the info you
are adding to your color card by using the drop-down menu.

The Header section of the Page Tab will give you options to adjust the height of the Header
area as well as the gap between the header and your color card information.

The Set Logo button will add a link to a logo file in your header. You can link either a
rasterized file or vector art. Regardless of the file size, Color Cards will rescale the file to fit
into the Header. Note: If you are using Vector Art, Color Cards will link your entire art board
into the header. Make sure to adjust the size of your art board to have a comfortable margin
around the vector art you want added to your header.




                                      Set Color will allow you to set the color in your Fill Box to
                                      the background color of the Header. To delete the Logo or
                                      Header Color, click the “X” button next to each button.

                                      Note: The amount of free space surrounding the linked logo
                                      file will determine how big or small it looks on the color card.

Use the Layout tab on the bottom of the Color Card window to adjust how your color chips
are presented on the page. You can choose a layout of either vertical or horizontal lines of
chips. You can check the Center Within Columns button to center align the Chips in each
column when vertically alignment is used. If you have created multiple Sections in your
Delivery, you can adjust the percentage the first Section takes up in that Delivery by choosing
a different percentage in the drop-down menu or by typing in a new percentage and pressing
Enter. You can change the Height, Width or Vertical and Horizontal gap of the color chips you
are using in your color cards.

                                                                   If you change the layout to horizontal
                                                                   lines of chips, you can create multiple
                                                                   rows of chips by adding a No Fill color

                                                                   underneath the Fill Box. Click the “+”
                                                                   button in the Palette Tab to add a

Use the Up and Down arrows to move the
“Spacer” up and down the Color List. The
“Spacer” creates a line break between the colors
and starts a new line after it.

Use the Show tab at the bottom of the Color Cards window to select the information about
the colors you want to present on the color card. This tab will allow you to show all the
names associated with the swatches, section names and borders on the chips. Choose as
many or as few items to display as you would like. The Show Light Chip Borders option will
add a light color border around the darker color of your palettes, the percentage field next to
it will control the level of darkness the lighter border will be applied to.

You may notice that all the elements are pushed right up to the edge of the art boards and
may be getting cut off if your printer requires a margin of space around your page. If you
check the Show Margins check box, printer margins will be added to your color card.




Once you have finished applying all the different settings to your color card layout, you can
save it as a template for future color cards. At the top of the Color Card window, there is a
Template section. Type in a name for you template in the Template field and click the “save”
button.

If you want to generate a quick color card of your palette without setting up Deliveries and
Sections, simply choose your palette and click the      button and a new file will be created
like the below example. You can choose more in info to display under the Show tab.




                                       TIPS & TRICKS
1. You can save a color card template and reuse it every time if you need your color cards
presented the same way all the time
2. The      button is a faster way of making a card of these chosen palette colors if they do
       not need editing.
3. You can create multiple rows of colors in each Delivery by using the “+” button to add a
       No Fill color and moving it in between colors.
4. You can manually move/delete/edit any of the labels added to the page with Illustrator
       tools if you’d like to alter the layout.
5. You’re able to add patterns to Palette Manager in addition to solid color swatches.
