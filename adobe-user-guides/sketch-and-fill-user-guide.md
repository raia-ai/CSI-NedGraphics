# Fashion Sketch & Fill for Adobe Illustrator

System Compatibilities:
Windows 10 Pro (64 bit) or MacOS with NedGraphics’ recommended setup. Contact NedGraphics for details.

Fashion Sketch allows designers to draw mirrored flat sketches with stitch lines, text and
measurement lines. To open the Fashion Sketch Tool, go to Window>Nedgraphics>Fashion
Sketch or click the   button on the Design Bar.

Starting in a brand new Illustrator document, you’ll notice there are two new tools that have
been added to Illustrator’s Main Tool Bar that are designed to work with the Fashion Sketch

The first is a new pen tool that works similarly to Illustrators Pen Tool, except curved lines
are made by pulling toward the curve, and bezier handles are only created on one side of a
point instead of both sides. Either pen tool will work with the symmetry line so use whichever
one you prefer.

The second tool is the Symmetry Line Tool. Use this tool to draw a symmetry line on your
document. Once created, anything drawing on one side of the line will be mirrored to the

It may take some getting used to, but the Fashion Pen Tool provides a much quicker way
to draw sketches on the symmetry line by using less points and less clicking to control the
curves of your lines. Note: The Fashion Sketch Pen Tool is available to in any other Illustrator
document. If you enjoy this pen tool as opposed to the one Illustrator provides, feel free to
use it for all future drawing needs!


“Ctrl+Shift+A” on PC to deselect the line.
continue this process for the rest of the

details in your sketch.

With the Fashion Sketch Tool, you can easily offset specific lines of your sketch to create
stitch lines. Use the Direct Select Arrow (the White Arrow) to select a line segment on your
sketch. In the Stitches section of the Fashion Sketch module, choose the distance you would
like to offset the stitch line. Select the type of Dashed Line you would like to use and the
Stitch Weight, which translates to the stroke weight of the line created.

Once you’ve decided the type of stitches, offset, and stitch weight, press the CREATE
button and a stitch line will automatically be added and reflected across the symmetry line.


to add a left chest pocket to our t-shirt,

click the RELEASE button.

The Symmetry Line will be removed from the page, and the selected element will no longer
have symmetry tied to it. If you change one side, the other side will not be affected. The
lines that were not selected, still have the symmetry function tied to them and will reflect any
changes made to one side regardless of the Symmetry Line being removed from the page.

With the Symmetry Line turned off, you can move the extra elements you’ve drawn onto your
sketch without having to worry about them duplicating on the other side. This is also a good
time to start adding additional asymmetrical elements, like shadows, folds, or asymmetrical
design elements.

The stitches that you first created are just simple, dashed lines. But what if your sketch
needs more than just a standard dashed stitch? Well, as part of our install, we include a huge
library of stitches, hardware, laces, and other trims as Brush Libraries.

To change one of your stitch lines to a new brush stitch, simply select the stitch line you
would like to change with the Selection Tool (Black Arrow), and click one of the stitch
brushes in the Brush Library. If the stitch was created with the Symmetry Line tied to it, the
reflected line will also update to the new stitch brush as well.

Adobe Illustrator is loaded with incredible drawing tools that you can use in combination with the

Fashion Sketch Tool to finish off your design.

The first trick involves Illustrator’s Width Tool

This tool allows you to adjust the stroke weight
of a line in specific areas only. It works great with our different stitch libraries to taper and tuck

stitches into folds or edges of the garment.

To get started, add some new stitches to your
sketch. You don’t have any stitches drawn at the sleeve seam, so we can select the line where the sleeve and body meet and offset it -1 with a stitch

line using the Fashion Sketch Tool.

Next apply a cover-lock stitch from the NedGraphics_Brushes Basic Stitches Library and
change the stroke weight to 0.5 pt with no dashed line. When you look at the area where the
new stitches end under the arm, they don’t look very realistic. They appear to just be floating
over the sleeve seam and ending abruptly.

To taper this stitch line and help it look a little more realistic, select the line with the Selection
Tool (Black Arrow) and then switch over to the Width Tool. Click and drag on the end point
of our stitch line and you will see two new handle bars that control the weight of the stroke

If you pull the handle bars all the way in to the end point of the stroke, you’ll see how the
brush will taper it’s width so that your stitch has some perspective as it vanishes under the
arm. Since it’s the only point we’ve applied a width, the stroke is tapered from one end point
to the other. It still doesn’t look very realistic because the stroke’s width is thinning out in the
middle. Press Cmd + Z (Mac) or Ctrl + Z (PC) to undo the Width Tool.

The Width Tool will also let you set new anchor width points anywhere on the line. Hover
the width tool over a new point on the line and you will see a white point follow your mouse.
Once you click and drag on that point, it will create a new width anchor point. This time,
drag the width anchors so they are about the same width as the rest of the brush width. Now
pinch the end point with the Width Tool and you’ll see the brush only tapers between the new
width anchor point you created and the end point you pinched. Continue following these
steps for any other stitches that need the added perspective the Width Tool can provide.

Once you have drawn in all the elements that make up your sketch, you can use some of
Illustrator’s tools to complete your sketch and create your shapes for coloring and filling with

Before you can start using the Shape Builder Tool, though, we’ll need to hide the stitch lines
and any other elements you don’t want to interfere with the shapes. Start by selecting one of
your stitch lines with the Selection Tool (Black Arrow).

With a single stitch line selected, either press the Select Similar Objects Button     on the
top Application Bar or go to Select > Same > Stroke Weight to select all elements in your
sketch that have 0.5 pt stroke weight. Then press Cmd+3 (Mac) or Ctrl+3 (PC) or go to
Object > Hide > Selection to hide all of your stitch lines. Use the same steps to hide all other
elements that would interfere with the main shapes until you are left with only the lines that
make up the basic shapes of the sketch.

If some of your shapes have gaps that are not allowing Shape Builder to close and create a
single shape, you can double-click the Shape Builder Tool to bring up it’s Options Window.

At the very top, check the Gap Detection Box, and toggle between the Gap Length drop
down options. Now the Shape Builder will automatically close any shape that has any gaps in
the lines. Click the OK button and continue using the Shape Builder Tool on the rest of your

When using the Shape Builder Tool, any shapes inside of another shape will create holes.
You can move the inside objects out of the way and use the Shape Builder Tool to click and
drag through the main shape and the hole to fill it. Move any elements back to their place.
Press Shift+Cmd+3 (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+3 (PC) to reveal all of the hidden elements.

Now that you have solid shapes to work with, you
can take advantage of Illustrator’s Stroke Effects and Clipping Mask Tools to create rib textures where needed. We can quickly add rib lines to our collar by

following these easy steps:

First, start with the Pen Tool and use No Fill Color with
a Stroke Color that matches the stroke color used in your sketch. Draw a single line through the middle of the front of the collar. The start and end of the line should extend well beyond the collar. You don’t have to be perfectly exact in following the shape of the collar either.

Select the line you just drew and in the Stroke Menu,
check the Dashed Line check box. Set the Dash at

0.5 pt. In our example, we are setting the Gap at 2 pt,
but you can set this at whichever size you feel best

represents the rib being used in your sketch.

Next, increase the Stroke Weight until your dashed
lines fall outside both the top and bottom of your collar shape.

Now all you have to do is duplicate the collar shape
to create a Clipping Mask. Select the collar shape and press Cmd+C (Mac) or Ctrl+C (PC) to copy it. Then, press Shift+Cmd+V (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+V (PC) to paste a new collar shape on top of everything else in

the exact same place as the original.

Select the pasted collar shape and the dashed stroke and press Cmd+7 (Mac) or Ctrl+7 (PC)
or go to Object > Clipping Mask > Make. Any areas of the dashed line that fall outside of the
collar shape will disappear and you will be left with a rib collar. Follow these same steps for
any other shapes that need to be filled with a rib texture. Once you are finished, save your
file, you now have a sketch that is ready for technical call outs or for making colorways.

The Technical Tab will provide quick options for adding technical call outs and measurements
for your sketch. To use the Measurement section, start by drawing a line from the High
Shoulder Point or any area of your sketch that you would like to add a measurement line to.

In the Measurement section of the Technical Tab, choose the Units you would like to use or
check the Ruler Units check box to use the Document’s current units and set the Precision.

In the Dimensions field, type in the length the measurement should be. So if the high
shoulder point is 40 inches, type in “40” and click the SET button. “40 in” is added to the
line we had selected. With the Selection Tool hold the Shift key down and select all the other
lines you would like to include measurement information with.

This time, instead of typing in a measurement and setting it, you can simply click the APPLY
button in the Measurement section. Dimensions will be added to all of your selected lines
based off of the scale of the original dimension you set earlier. In the Arrows section of the
Technical tab you have the options to stylize your measurement lines with arrowheads. To
apply arrowheads, pick a style in the drop down menus for the start and end of each line.
You can set the scale of the arrowheads underneath the drop down menus. Finally check,
the Apply Arrow Choice check box. With the check box checked, any element you select will
have arrowheads added to it. Make sure to uncheck the box when you are finished!

In the last sketch, your measurements might not be exact because you were drawing your
sketch freehand. You can use the type tool to change the automated dimensions if you need
to. Another option is to draw your sketch to scale by setting your dimensions first and then
drawing your sketch to scale with the Line Properties section of the Design Tab.

Start by selecting the Line Segment Tool in Illustrator’s Main Tool Bar. Click on the top left
corner of your art board to bring up the Line Segment Tool Options and create a line that is
3 in length at a 0 degree angle. Select the line and switch to the Technical Tab in the Fashion
Sketch window. In the Dimensions field, type in “25” and use inches for your Unit type. Click
the SET button to apply the new dimension to your document.

Draw your Symmetry Line down the center of the page and use either pen tool to add a new
point near the top of the Symmetry Line. Now, instead of drawing out our sketch with the
pen tools, we’ll use the Line Properties section of the Design Tab to type out the distance
and angle of each point. The Line Properties section may be grayed out at first. To activate
this section press Cmd+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (PC). The Length field allows you set the distance
the next point will be from the previous point. The Angle field determines the angle from the
previous point. After filling both fields and pressing the Enter/Return Key, a new line will be

Since you have previously determined the scale of this document, type
in the actual length of your first line in the Length field and the angle
you would like to place it at. It may take some practice to get used to
the angles. The following graphic offers a bit of a cheat sheet to get
an understanding of the angles created from the center point.

The Create and Modify radio dial buttons will determine whether the
info in the Length and Angle fields create a new line from the last

point added or modify the last line created.

By default, new lines are straight, if you would like to curve the line use Cmd+< (Mac) or
Ctrl+< (PC) to curve the line to the left and Cmd+> (Mac) or Ctrl+> (PC) to curve the line
to the right. Type in a new Length and Angle and press the Return/Enter key to make your
second line. Continue this process to draw out the shape of your sketch. You can use either
pen tool to fill in details afterwards.

The Export Tab will allow you to add a pre-designed template to either your current document
or a new document and export front and back views of your sketches. To get started, check
either This Doc to add the template to the current document you have open or New Doc to
create a new document with the template. Then press the TEMPLATE button.
If you chose to create a new document with the template, Illustrator will create a new letter
size document in landscape view. Copy and paste your sketches into the two main areas.

To export separate rasterized artwork of the front and back views of the sketch you have
opened, first select the Resolution of your rasterized artwork in the drop down menu at the
bottom of the Export Tab. Select the This Doc option and click the EXPORT button. You
will be asked to choose a folder to save your rasterized artwork. Click the OK button and
navigate to the location you would like to export your artwork and click the Choose button.

Navigate to the destination you chose for your rasterized artwork. You will see two PNG files
with the same file name as the AI file they were generated from with a “_BACK.png” and
“_FRONT.png” extensions.

If you have many different sketch files that you need to export as rasterized artwork, you
can use the Export Tab to create rasterized artwork for multiple files all at once. To do this,
click on the Select Files option and click the EXPORT button. Navigate to the files you would
like to create raster artwork from. These files should have previously been created with the
Template option from the Export Tab. Select as many files as you would like to export and
then click the Choose button. You will be prompted to choose a destination for the new
raster artwork. Click the OK button on the pop up window and navigate to the location you
would like to save the new files. Click the Choose button. Then click OK to dismiss the
confirmation pop up window.

1. Be careful not to select any of the asymmetrical pieces while the Symmetry Line is visible,
a duplicate will be created on the other side.
2. To delete only one symmetrical element, select it and click the RELEASE button, Then
delete the element. To bring the Symmetry Line back, select an element that was created
with the Symmetry Line and click the SHOW LINE button.
3. There is a large library of stitch, hardware, trim and accessory options under your Brush
Menu by going to Open Brush Library > NedGraphics Brushes
4. Use the Shape Builder Tool to close the symmetrical pieces

Fashion Utility will help you fill your sketches with color or pattern with only a few clicks. You
can open the Fashion Utility Tool by going to Window > NedGraphics > Fashion Utility or by
clicking on the       button on the Design Bar.

Make sure the shapes of the artwork you would like to recolor are filled with a solid color.
Refer to page 12 to see how to close a sketch and fill shapes with the Shape Builder Tool.

Start by opening a document containing a fashion sketch you would like to color up if you
don’t already have one open.

You will also want to set up your Destination options. If you want vector copies of your
sketch in new colorways, you can choose whether the vector copies will be placed in the
same document or a new document by selecting either the Same Doc or New Doc options.

The Same Doc option places all filled bodies in the same file that the original or source art
is in. Same Doc - New Artboards will place all filled bodies on new artboards in the same file
and New Doc creates a new AI document with all filled bodies on new Artboards.

If you have a color palette or specific patterns you would like to fill your sketch with, make
sure to add them to the Main Swatch Menu.

To fill your sketch with new colors and patterns, use the Selection Tool (Black Arrow) to
select your entire sketch. Hold down the Cmd key (Mac) or Ctrl key (PC) and select all of the
colors and patterns in your Swatch Menu that you would like to fill your sketch with. Click the
“FILL” button in the Fashion Utility window.

If you had the Same Doc option checked, duplicates of your sketch will be created in a
row with each color that you selected from your Swatch window. Each of these fills will be
grouped so you can easily click and move them to the location you would like to display

If you had the “New Doc” option checked, Illustrator
will create a new AI file with your original sketch and duplicates of each color and/or pattern that you selected in your Swatch Menu. They will be placed on their own art boards and grouped individually for you to easily arrange them on you need to. The colorways in the new AI file are the same scale as the original selected sketch. The art boards are

scaled to fit the sketch size.

If you filled your sketch with a pattern, you may notice that it places the pattern at 100%
scale. You can easily edit the scale, position, and angle of your pattern with some Illustrator
shortcuts. Once you apply these changes to the pattern, any new patterns filled with the
Fashion Utility tool will be placed at the exact same scale, position, and angle. To adjust the
scale of the pattern, select the entire sketch and press the S key to bring up the Scale Tool.
Hold down Shift + ~ and click and drag to resize the pattern. You can also go to Object >
Transform > Scale. Then, uncheck Scale Objects and check Scale Pattern. Type in a new
percentage in the Uniform field to accurately scale your pattern.

You can move the position of the pattern by selecting it with the selection tool and moving
it to a different area while holding the ~ key. To rotate the pattern, select the shape you
would like to rotate the pattern within. Tap the R key to bring up the Rotate Tool. Then while
holding down the ~ key, click and drag to rotate the pattern.

The Cascade tab allows for options on the layout of the filled bodies. Set these options prior
to hitting the Fill button to apply layout changes.

Aside from filling your entire sketch with solid colors and patterns, you can also target a
specific color in a sketch with more than one color.

To start, use the Direct Select Tool (White Arrow) and select a single object with the fill color
you would like to change. Then, press the SELECT button in the Change Specific Color box.
The DESELECT button will clear the color and let you choose a different selection color.

Because you selected the New Doc option, a new file is created with a new sketch on its
own art board for each swatch you selected. Only the areas of the original sketch with the
selected colors will be filled with the colors and patterns picked in the Swatch Menu.

If you need a rasterized copy of your colorways, you can use the Export Without Filling
option. The best way to use this function would be to do a fill using the New Doc or Same
Doc- New Artboards options so that each colorway to be exported is on it’s own artboard.
Select Artboards under Source. When you use this function, you do not need to select
anything on the document. Select the file type under the Export Without Filling section and
hit EXPORT. This will export all artboards on the file as individual JPEG or PNG files.

In all previous examples we’ve been using the “Selected Art” option in the Source box. This
option lets you select shapes that will be recolored. If you have multiple files with sketches
that need to be recolored with the same colors, you can use the other two options: “All Open

We have provided options in the configuration of the software to be able to place text fields

1. Make sure artwork is one solid piece to color as to avoid gaps in fill colors.
2. Check the Opaque Art Only to only fill shapes that have 100% opacity. Uncheck this box if
you want to fill both opaque and transparent art.

3. Use the Select button to choose only pieces of art to fill with the selected colors/patterns
instead of filling entire artwork with a single color/pattern.
4. The Export button will allow you to create files of your colorways without having to fill 		
them in the current document This will bring up a Save As window allowing you to name the file and choose the file destination.

5. If you try filling a body and get the same fill in all colorways instead of the swatches from
the palette, make sure the Fill is on top of the Stroke in the main AI toolbar and also try hitting Deselect on the Fashion Utility tool and try filling again.

EXPLORING THE LAYOUT OF THE CHIP UP TOOL

The Chip Up Tool allows you to quickly place color chips on a file of all colors in an artwork.

Chip Up allows users to quickly and easily generate and call out colors for multiple pieces
of art on separate artboards with different colorways. To start, we’ll set up an Illustrator
document with artboards and artwork ready to go. Select the Chip Up tool from the
NedGraphics Design Bar, or from Window> NedGraphics>Chip Up. Then, go into the Chip
Up tool and set your color workspace to RBG or CMYK. A best practice is to match the tool
to your current document color space.

You can set the font and font size to text already on the
page, and then hit the “Set” button at the top of the tool

to save your font for color chip names.

Set up your artboards where you will place each colorway art and call-outs. You can set up
artboards in the new document window or with the Edit Artboards tool. Once the artboards
are set up, use the rectangle tool and place it over the artboard where the art will be. Select
the rectangle area and click the SET button next to the Art Region. Only set it for the first
artboard. The tool will apply the art and chip regions to the other artboards as well.

Once the regions are set you can delete the rectangles from the page. Then, go and set
the color chip height, width, and spacing in the “Chips” section of the tool. The maximum
number of chips equals the total numbers of color chips allowed per page. Max chip spacing
is the spacing between color chips, and max section spacing is the spacing between
sections. Chips can be separated into sections based off if they are set as constant chips or

Place the artwork on each artboard in the artwork region. Any artwork that is not inside of
the art region will not generate a color chip. You can also create regions over existing art on
the first artboard as well. With the regions set, click the COLORS button after artwork has
been placed in the art region to populate artboard colors. Chips will appear vertically in the
chip region area for each artboard.

Swatch names will appear below each color chip. Chips with colors not currently in the
Ai Swatches box will have “NOT SWATCH COLOR” called out beneath it in red. Pattern
swatches are also usable and will show up named as whatever has been indicated in the
Illustrator Swatches menu.
