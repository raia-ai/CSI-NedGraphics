To work on the repeat of artwork in NedGraphics Design For Adobe Photoshop, you must
first reduce and apply colors to the artwork file. To reduce and clean a print before making
a repeat, refer back to NedGraphics Design for Adobe Photoshop: Color Reduction and
Cleaning guidebook. If you already have a file that has been color reduced, open it in
Photoshop and make sure it’s saved as a .psd file. Go to Plugins>NedGraphics For Adobe
Photoshop > NedGraphics.




Make sure any blend modes, filters, masks, and smart objects are rasterized before moving
into the NedGraphics Design environment. Flattening the image is not necessary and you are
able to keep layers in tact if you choose to do so.

Once the NedGraphics plug-in window opens, click the “Design For Photoshop” or “run”
button to launch the file into the module.

The module will open
in a new environment
which can also be
docked on your mac
home bar. You’re
able to open artwork
directly through
the application
and overpass the
Photoshop portion by
opening the tool from
the dock and clicking
“File > Open”.

You can use palettes to color your print by using a palette that was built in Palette Manager
or by opening an .ase palette that was built in Photoshop or Illustrator. Note: if Palette
Manager has been used to create palettes, they will automatically show up here upon
opening NedGraphics Design.

      COLOR REDUCING ART IN NEDGRAPHICS DESIGN

Each time you open new artwork in the NedGraphics Design environment, the below window
will launch with a prompt asking if you would like the colors of the artwork to automatically
be added to the print or if you would like to manually select the colors to use in your print.




You have the option to color reduce your
artwork before moving into the tool by
converting your .psd to index color mode
before entering the Design environment. In
this case, you would click “yes” at the prompt,
and the index color table will be added to the
Solid Colors Box. For a more advance color
reduction option, leave your file in RGB mode
before entering the Design tool, and click “No”
at the prompt to do a reduction directly in the
tool.



                                                                      Before picking the colors you
                                                                      would like to use in your print, click

                                                            You can continue to add colors into the
                                                            Solid Colors field to reduce your print.
                                                            There will be a number in parenthesis after
                                                            the title “Solid Colors” which will indicate
                                                            the number of colors in your print. If you
                                                            add colors you do not want in your print,
                                                            you can delete them. Select the colors you
                                                            would like to delete. Press the Trash Can
                                                            button and click “Yes” on the prompt.



With the Eyedropper Tool, select the darkest shade of the color you want to make a blend
for. Then, instead of dragging it to the Solid Color window, drag it to the left side of the
Color Blending Bar right underneath it. This will create groups of colors that behave together
and are tonal steps, shaded from the lightest to the darkest colors chosen.

                       Next, select the lightest shade of the
                       color you want to turn into a blend with
                       the Eyedropper Tool. Drag this swatch
                       to the far right end of the Color Blending
                       bar. Blend steps will be automatically
                       generated between the two swatches you
                       just added to the Color Blending bar. By
                       default, the Color Blending bar will create
                       8 steps between the two chosen colors.
                       Underneath the bar, there is an option called
                       Blend Steps to change the number of steps
                       created between the two shades.

Note: You can click directly on the light and dark tone boxes to add
colors as well, instead of dragging color from the Fill.

                  REDUCING WITH BLEND TONES CONTINUED...
Continue selecting colors you would like to add to your print with the Eyedropper Tool and
adding them either in the Solid Colors window or the Color Blend bar until the artwork in
the Preview pane looks close enough to the Image Viewer pane or until you’ve reached the
maximum number of colors you can use. Your Color Blends can vary in number of blend
steps if necessary. You can also make the blends in order from dark to light or light to dark.
You can change the order later by right-clicking or Ctrl-clicking on the color group and
selecting “Reverse Group Order.”




You can always adjust the number of blend steps
in each color group after they are created. First,
select all of the swatches in a color group and
click on the arrows in the Blend Steps field to
increase or decrease the number of steps in a color. Once you’ve adjusted the number of
Blend Steps, click the Refresh button to the right of the + button and your color group will be
updated to the new number of Blend Steps.


Once you have added your solid and color groups, click the “Apply” button to apply your color
selections to the artwork. The preview window will disappear and the new artwork that is
displayed is your color reduced print. The button will switch from yellow to white.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP: if the Apply button is not pressed, most tools on the
tool bar will not work.

        CLEANING ARTWORK IN NEDGRAPHICS DESIGN
To start cleaning, click on a color that needs to be cleaned up. Click on the Isolation Mode
button and the selected color will be replaced by black while the remaining colors in the print
are desaturated. This view mode will help you identify all the areas the selected color appears
in the print and where it should be cleaned.




You can change the black color used in Isolation Mode at any time. If you double-click on the
Main Swatch box and select a new color and then drag and drop it onto the Isolation Mode
button. The button background color will change to that swatch color and the isolation color
will be updated in the artwork.




                                           Once in Isolation Mode, you can now use the cleaning
                                           tools to eliminate any loose areas of color. The
                                           cleaning tools are under the fourth button down on the
                                           Main Tool bar. If you click and hold on this button, you
                                           will be given three options to clean with:
                                           Rectangular cleaning, lasso cleaning, and brush
                                           cleaning.

        CLEANING ARTWORK IN NEDGRAPHICS DESIGN
Any time you select a tool on the Main Tool bar, options for that tool will appear in the top
menu. With the Rectangular Cleaning Tool selected, click on the shape drop-down menu.
You have two options, either to clean out the entire isolated color that you highlight or clean
blobs, or specific area sizes of the isolated color. Select the Blobs option. The drop-down
menu to the right of the Blobs option is where you will define the size of shapes you would
like to clean by pixels. You can select a number from the list or type one in yourself. Clicking
the = button in between the numbers will allow you to choose two different width and height
values. The last step to do before cleaning is check the Show Preview option underneath the
Image Viewer. The Preview pane will let you see what’s happening to the colors after using
the Cleaning Tool.




Now, click and drag or draw across an area of the artwork in the Image Viewer window that
you like to clean up. Once you release the cursor, any areas less than the number of pixels
you previously defined will be cleaned up and re-colored to the nearest neighbor pixel colors.




The tool will calculate which colors surrounds the isolated pixels that are being cleaned
and automatically determine which color to change them to in order to match the rest of
your print. Using the Blobs function, you can clean specific areas at a time or zoom out by
pressing Cmd - (Mac) or Ctrl - (PC) and draw a rectangle around the entire artwork. Using
the Blobs method to clean is a great for cleaning all of the small, loose pixels. If you have
a complicated print with a lot of different colors, you might opt to use the lasso or brush
cleaning tools to get a little more precise in your cleaning. To get out of Isolation Mode,
select the swatch/swatches that are being isolated and click the Isolation Mode button again.
Continue to isolate each color in your print and clean it as necessary. Once you are finished
cleaning, uncheck the Show Preview button and save your work.

With your color reduced file open in the NedGraphics Design module, click the “Start” button
in the Repeat Control section. Your artwork will repeat around itself infinitely. You can adjust

When you click and drag inside the crop handles and move the crop lines to a different area
of the print, your original artwork stays stationary and the repeat keeps adjusting to the new
area you place the crop marks over. If you drag the crop handles outward and away from the
artwork, you can create some space around the art to fill in later to make your repeat.




You can press the Esc key if you would like to
reset your crop marks back to the edges of your
original artwork and start over. When you are
satisfied with where your artwork is going to be
cropped either press the Return/Enter key or
click on a different tool and then click the Yes
button on the prompt.

                        USING THE ANCHOR + CROP TOOLS
The Anchor Tool       allows you to crop based on a color position as opposed to artwork
bounding edges. This comes in handy when cropping down a background color, but needing
to keep your motifs intact. Select the color or colors you would like to anchor, and then
select the anchor icon on the tool bar. In this example, the blue background is anchored.




(Note: Make sure you select
the layer with the color you
would like to anchor first.)

You can redraw any shapes that were cut off by
the edges of your artwork using the Single Color
Fill Brush    . You can control the brush size in
the top menu or by clicking the “[“ key to make the
brush size smaller or the “]” key to make the brush
size larger. Either select a color from the Solid
Colors or Color Blending sections, or use the Eye
Dropper (press and hold ALT so you don’t have to
switch back and forth between the two tools) to
select a color from your artwork. Click and drag
the brush to paint out the shape you would like to
draw.

                       SINGLE COLOR FILL TOOL & BRUSHES
The Single Color Fill Brush works great for drawing out shapes of solid color but if you need
to draw out textures and gradients we have a few more options for you. First look at the top
menu under the Single Color Fill Brush options. The button with a black dot is your brush
type. If you click this button, a window will open up with multiple different brush types that
you can experiment with to build certain textures. The brush library will drop down from
the menu, the brush heads within each are in the box and update when an- other library is
chosen from the menu. The size and spacing can be changed as well for more control at the
bottom on the window. Hit OK to draw with the selected options.




Another option is to adjust the Fill % of your brush. Using the Basic brush shape, change the
percentage in the Fill field to 50%. Now when you paint with a color, it fills only 50% of the
brush area like a stippling brush. The more you paint over an area, the more it fills. Using this
technique is a great way for painting out gradients of color.

Underneath the Single Color Fill Brush tool on the Main Tool Bar are three other options for
drawing new artwork. The first tool is the Rectangular Single Color Filling Tool.         This tool
will draw rectangles that will fill with your selected color. If you click and hold your cursor on
this button, you will find the Lasso and Polygon Single Color Filling Tool and underneath.
These tools are great for letting you draw custom shapes that will automatically fill with your
selected color after you release the cursor.

                                                                    You can also set a stroke color around

You can lock specific colors or groups of colors to help you draw out overlapping shapes
much quicker. Select a color or a single color in a color group and press the pad lock button
in between the Solid Colors and Color Blending fields. Locking a color will prevent it from
being changed in your artwork.

When you reduce your colors, some of the textures or color blends might look a little rough
and patchy. You may want to smooth out the transitions between the shades. You can use
the Blend Brush tool  to mix existing colors in your design to create indexed blurs and
smooth gradients.




Start by selecting the Blend Brush tool. At the top menu bar, you can change the size of the
brush, choose the brush type, and select the density of the blend function.



Just as the other brush tools, you can also change the brush size with the left and right
bracket keys. You can choose a Density property between 1-10 where 1 is the least amount of
scattered of pixels and 10 is the most amount of scattered pixels within the areas you paint
over with the Blend Brush tool.


With the Blend Brush properties set, start
painting over the areas of your design
you would like to smooth out.
It will look like you are painting with a
color at first, but don’t worry, once you
release your cursor the colors you painted
over will be scattered and blended
together to create smooth transitions
between colors. You can adjust the
density as you use the Blend Brush
in different areas to create smoother
blends.

Area selection tools can be used for many different things. Instead of drawing out the
remaining edges of your repeat, you can also copy and paste motifs to edit and move to the
edges. The second tool down on the Main Tool Bar is the selection tool. If you click and hold
the cursor on this button you will have two drawing options to choose from. The Rectangular
Area Selection Tool will draw a selection box and the Lasso Area Selection Tool will allow
you to make custom selection shape areas. Use the Lasso Selection Tool to circle a motif,
you don’t have to be exact with the edges of the motif.




Once you release the cursor, press Cmd+C (Mac)
or Ctrl+C (PC) to copy the area you have selected
and then Cmd+V (Mac) or Ctrl+V (PC) to paste the
selected area onto a new layer. This is one of the
best features of NedGraphics Design because now
you can work with layers while in a color reduced
environment.




                                                                    Switch to the Arrow Tool at the top

With the Arrow Tool selected, in the options above it in the top menu you can check the
Transform check box to scale or rotate the layer. You can also press the “T” key to activate
the Transform function as well.

                                                              With the Transform function turned on

                                                              the bounding box to rotate the elements.
                                                              Once you are finished transforming the

In the Transform Panel, you can rotate, flip, and mirror layers. When “Mirror within layer” is
checked, the mirroring will stay on that layer and it will expand the layer size. If it is on the
background layer, it will expand the repeat size.




You can also do this in the Edit menu by going to Edit > Reflect Image. Here you can rotate
the selected image at set 90 degree and 180 degree angles or select “Any Angle” to type in a
specific degree.

Note: Transform in Place works as well by making a selection, either with the Magic Wand
or Area Selections and hitting “V” or selecting the Arrow tool at the top of the tool bar. Hit
“T” for Transform or check the box at the top left corner of the window and rotate, scale or
move the selected art. It will cut away from the background and stay on the same layer.

Just like in Photoshop, you can hide selected layers.
Next to each layer in the Layers Menu is an eye graphic.
Click on the eye to hide or un-hide the layers. With the
first layer hidden, we can clean up the edges of our
pasted motif.

To clean up the edges of this layer we can use a combination of locking colors and the Eraser
Tool . First, select all of the colors you do not want to erase and press the Lock Button.
Now select the Eraser Tool and start erasing all the elements on the outside of the shapes
you copied. Only the unlocked colors will be erased and you will end up with perfect cutouts
of your shape. Once finished, unlock all of the colors by selecting them and clicking the Lock
Button again. You can also un-hide any hidden layers by clicking on the eye graphic next to
them.




Like all other tools we have covered so far, you also have an option to use the Eraser Tool as
a rectangle, lasso, or polygon.




Another way to remove unwanted areas
is by using the paint bucket tool. By
selecting the paint bucket and the “none”
swatch inside the solid colors box, you
can paint out areas of the motifs like
edge colors or background sections.

If you are using Color Groups in your artwork, you can use the Group Color Painting Tool
to recolor these areas. Click on any of the swatches in the Color Blending window to select
the Color Group. Using the Group Color Painting Tool start brushing over another color
group in your artwork. The tool will target only other color groups and leave all other solid
colors alone.




As with all tools, there is also an option to draw in rectangles or with a lasso or polygon tool.
Make sure to lock any color groups you do not want the Group Color Lasso Painting Tool to
affect.

Instead of copy and pasting extra layers you also have an option of using the Clone Stamp
Tool     to duplicate areas of artwork onto the same layer. The Clone Stamp Tool works
exactly the same way it does in Photoshop.

                                                       First, select the layer you would like to work
                                                       on and pick a source you would like to start
                                                       copying from by holding down the Option
                                                       key (Mac) or Alt key (PC) and clicking on the
                                                       source area.

                                                       Next move the cursor to the area you would
                                                       like start cloning the source area and start
                                                       brushing out your shape. You will see a brush
                                                       cursor at the source location as well as the
                                                       new location you moved to.





Motifs that are copy and pasted in the artwork will be pasted into their own new layer, but
you can also make a new blank layer to work on. To do this, make sure the background layer
is selected in the layers panel and click the + button, or you can go to the Edit menu at the
top of the page>Add Transparent Image. The new layer will be the size of your repeat. You
can continue to draw and work on the repeat in this layer. You can make the layer larger or
smaller by using the crop tool.




                                 New Blank Layer




Remember to make sure “Draw past image bounds” is checked when you are in the brush
tool if you want to fix the edges of the repeat and draw over the repeat boundaries in the
new layer.

the “Options” button in the finder window to select file type. Then, navigate to the raster
artwork, select it and press the OK button.

                                                    The image will be added to your artwork, but
                                                    it will not be color reduced. You will need to
                                                    either reduce it, by selecting colors with the eye

Click Apply to reduce the new image and use any of the toolbar tools to edit the image. If
you need to delete the layer, select it in the Layers list and press “Delete” on the keyboard
(NOT the Backspace button) or go to Edit > Delete Image.

Use the gradient tool to make smooth blends and transitions between colors without adding
any additional colors to your artwork. When you select the Gradient Tool Button          there
will be additional tool options at the top left corner of the NedGraphics Deswign window.
Create your gradient by dragging colors that are already in the solid or blend groups onto the
gradient blend bar. To update an existing color in the gradient, select the triangle beneath
that color; it will then show that color in the square to the right. Drag and drop the new color
onto that box and it will be updated. To add more colors to the gradient, simply drag and
drop the new colors onto the gradient bar.

A gradient can be applied to an entire layer or a selection. If applying it to a layer, you can
select the gradient tool and simply click and drag the mouse across the layer in the direction
you want the gradient to go after setting it up. To apply it to a selection, first use the magic
wand tool or the Area Selection tool to make your selection. Then, navigate to the Gradient
tool to set up the gradient colors as shown above.

                                                                           Colors must already be part of the

                           Once the colors are added to the gradient bar, use the triangles
                           beneath each color to distribute them. To delete a color, click on
                           its triangle to select the color and hit the trash can icon.

To update an existing color, select the color in the gradient and then drag the new color from
the solid color box and drop it on to the color selection box to the right of the gradient. The
percentage box next to the selected color box will allow you to choose more precisely where
this color will be placed in the gradient. The orange color in the image above was set to 50%
so it is exactly in the center of the gradient.

Once you’re happy with how the gradient is set up, use your mouse to click and drag the
direction and length you want the gradient to go in inside of the selection that you made
earlier. When you release the mouse, the gradient will fill the selection.





The Fill Pattern tool allows you to fill up a color position with the contents of another image
or pattern. This can be used to replace solid backgrounds with textures to simulate printing
on fabric, large areas of ombres and gradients, or just drop in a simple polka-dot pattern into
specific motifs within the artwork.

Remember to use this with patterns that have already been reduced or indexed or else you
will have to reduce the patterns after in your NedGraphics Design document.

Pattern Fills will only go to solid color positions, so make
sure the color you want to replace is a solid color as opposed
to a blend color first. To add a pattern fill, go to the
Edit menu>Fill Pattern.

Once you’ve selected your pattern image, go to “Pick Color.” It will open a window of your
solid colors. Select the positions you want the pattern to fill and click OK.

                                                                           Select “Add new colors” if you

Next you’ll decide how to fill the color position. Check “Scale to fit” to resize the pattern
to your repeat size or type in the number of times your pattern repeats up and down. You
will see empty space in the preview window where the pattern fill ends if “scale to fit” isn’t
checked and the pattern isn’t set to repeat enough times.




You can flip or rotate the pattern, or change
its origin point. Click OK when done or
Cancel to exit.


Note: Only solid colors (colors in the solid colors box) are able to be chosen to be replaced
by a pattern fill. In the case of this artwork where the background was originally a blend, we
moved the blend group into the solid colors box to be able to complete this function. Please
refer to the “Colorist” portion of this manual to see how to move and merge colors in the
solid and blending box areas.

You can also add a pattern fill from an existing layer in the artwork. In the next example,
we added an ombre image onto its own layer (via Add Image), added its colors to the
NedGraphics Design document as solid colors, and mirrored the image to make it repeat
vertically before going to “Fill Pattern”. The artwork is smaller than the repeat size, but we will
make it repeat later on in the workflow.




Now that they layer is set up, go to “Fill Pattern” in the Edit menu. This time check “Select
from layer” and pick the layer of the image you want.



                                                       Check “Use Current Color” because the applied
                                                       colors already includes the layer’s colors.

                                                       We set the gradient image to fill the
                                                       background twice vertically so we can see the
                                                       pattern repeat in the background.

                                                       Hit OK when finished.

         CONVERTING AN OFFSET REPEAT TO A STRAIGHT REPEAT

If you have designed your repeat in Drop or Shift, you have the option to turn it back into a
straight repeat tile by using the “Convert” button in the Repeat panel. The ground layer of the
artwork will extend to become the size of the repeat tile and the repeat will switch to be in
Straight repeat mode.




In this example, the artwork was created as a half drop. After hitting the “Convert” button,
the repeat type switched to the straight repeat tile and the size of the artwork changed to be
that of the full repeat size.

your artwork will be displayed as a single repeat tile with color chips placed underneath it.




When you launch the Colorist Module, you will see a thumbnail on the left side on the side
of the screen named “Original.” The Original colorway can not be changed so you will need
to click the + button at the bottom of the screen to create a new colorway. By default new
colorways will be named “Colorway #.” If you would like to edit the name, double-click
“Colorway 1” and type in a new name and click the OK button.

To start recoloring your artwork, open the
palette you would like to use by either toggling
through the Brand, Year, and Palette drop-down
menus or by clicking the       button and opening
an .ase palette file. With a palette open, you can
click and drag one of the swatches over the top
of one of your solid colors. When you release
the cursor, the color will be updated in your
artwork and in the chips displayed underneath.
Continue dragging new colors to the other solid
colors to change them.

To change a Color Group, first select one of
the swatches in the Color Groups window to
update the Color Blending bar with the color you
want to change. Select a new swatch from your
palette window and drag it on top of one end of
the Color Blending bar.




To recolor the other side of the Color Blending bar, you can drag and drop another swatch
from your palette or you can use the Quick Color bar at the top of the screen to find a tonal
shade of the first color used in the Color Blending bar. Click on the swatch you just changed
in the Color Group window. The Quick Color bar will update to generate three darker shades
and three lighter shades of this color. To use one of the shades, click and drag it onto the
other side of the Color Blending bar.

You can also mix your own custom colors
to recolor your design. At the left side
of the screen, double-click on the Main
Swatch to open the Color Picker window.
You can either select from the custom
color options, type in your RGB values, or
move your cursor around in the color field
to find the right shade. Once you find a
color you like, you can drag it to one of
the vacant spaces underneath the Custom
Colors section to use it again later or just
click the OK button.

                                                       steps between them. You can select shades
                                                       from the blend steps and drag them onto solid
                                                       colors to recolor them from the tonal options.

                                                       You can also blend solid color positions in

                                                       between the two end color chips.





You can match all color positions in one or muliptle colorways to a specific palette. Choose
your palette from the Brand, Year, and Palette sections; or open a palette file by clicking
the Open ASE button and choosing your color palette file. Click the Match button to have
the color chips recolored to the closest color match from your palette. In Colorist, only the
colorways that you have selected from the colorways panel will be matched.

Continue to update each color in your design until you are satisfied with your new colorway.
To create a new colorway, press the + button again at the bottom of the screen. Colorway 2
is added in the Colorways Preview Window. You can delete a colorway by selecting it in the
Colorways Preview Window and pressing the trash can button.




To confirm the match worked, double click on
a color to view and edit the color name. You
can rename colors as well by double clicking
the swatch in the Color Chips section. Type in
a new name and click the OK button.

If you would like to further reduce the colors in your colorways, you can merge solid colors or
color groups by holding down the Shift key and selecting more than one color. Right-click or
Ctrl-click one of the selected colors and choose the Merge Colors or Merge Groups option.
Solid colors will merge into the furthest selected color on the left and color groups will merge
into the top most selected color.

Merging can also happen on all made colorways at once. To do this, check the box at the
top of the color boxes and then choose the groups or solid colors to merge, right click and
choose the merge option. Note: This will apply to all colorways made, regardless of selected
colorway icons. It will also disable being able to add additional colorways from the Original,
as this has more colors in it than the rest. You can merge on individual colorways or on all,
but you will not be able to use both features in a single file.

                                                                          You can also swap color positions

You can save the layout you just set up as a template to use on future designs. Click

By default it will be named “Template” and “Template-#,” but you can change it by double-

straight to the Template Tab, select your template and click the     button. If the artwork
seems misaligned, you can adjust the settings in the Display Tab to make sure the artwork is
being displayed as the same size as what was used in the template.


With your design layout all set, you are ready to export the file. There
are three different versions of your artwork you can send off in the
export panel which can be found under File>Export.

The first time you engage this window and choose options, it will
remember those options and populate them as preferences the next
time you go to export. Choose any or all options to export at once.

The last tab in the Colorist options is the Region Tab. Here you will be able to select just a
portion of your design to export multiple colorways on a single page.

Switch to the Rectangle Tool in the Main Tool Bar and click and drag a selection over your
artwork. Dimensions will hover next to your cursor so you will know the size of the area as
you draw it.

If you would like to move the selection area you just drew, you can switch to the Arrow
Tool, click inside the selection area and drag it to a new location. Once you are satisfied with
the placement, click the “Set” button to apply the selection as a region. The border of the
selection area should get a little thicker after you press the Set button. You can still move
this area if you need to by clicking and dragging it to another location.




You can save the region settings as a template as well so that you can apply the same
settings again with future art- work. Click the + button in the Templates Section and you will
see a new name in the list appear. The naming convention is “Region_(region dimensions)_
on_(page size).” To apply a region to new artwork, select it in the list and click the check
button. Delete a region by pressing the X button. Next, select all of the colorways you
would like to export and go to File > Export and make sure “Multiple per page” is selected
under Colorways. You can choose to place all regions onto one page, or indicate how many
colorway regions horizontally and vertically per page.

                                       TIPS & TRICKS

1. NedGraphics Design is used for rasterized prints only.
2. When bringing in artwork initially, make sure you save a copy of the original artwork so you
always have a source file you can go back to.
3. Make sure to click the “Apply” button after choosing colors in order for the other design
tools to work with the print.
4. Always remember what you save in NedGraphics Design will be saved to the .PSD file you
launched from Photoshop.
5. The Crop Tool can be used to crop out sections of art or pulled away to generate more
space around your artwork.
6. Use the Paint Bucket to fill in large areas of color.
7. Lock colors to quickly draw layered elements.
8. Use the background color with the Lasso Fill Tool to erase any elements you don’t want in
your artwork.
9. Use the eraser tool with locked colors to quickly cut elements on pasted layers.
10. When you see the message “Please select an image” repeatedly, click on the Arrow tool
and select the art on the document that you are trying to work on.
11. Show Preview should only be checked when color reducing and cleaning. Otherwise the

as floating panels will help create more space for the print window.

mostly complete. However, if you exit Colorist (Window > Colorist), any edits done in Design
will automatically be applied to all colorways when Colorist is launched again.

Colors boxes in Design before opening Colorist to recolor. It will bring in the color order as
they appear in the Design window.
