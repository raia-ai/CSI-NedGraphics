# Design Bar for Adobe Illustrator

System Compatibilities:
Windows 10 (64 bit) Version 20H2 or higher, or macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher.

The Design Bar is a way to quickly access our color palette management tools, Textile Design
tools, and Fashion Design tools. In addition to these tools, the Design Bar also houses our
Quick Transformation Tools, Quick Colors, Raster Utilities, and the Show Dimensions
and Crop Marks functions. The Nedgraphics For Adobe Illustrator Icon at the front of the
Design Bar will give you access to Preferences, License Information, Release Updates, User
Manuals, and Remote Support.

With Adobe Illustrator open, to access the Design Bar, click on Window on the top menu
and scroll to NedGraphics> Design Bar. To close the Design Bar, do the same, Window >
NedGraphics> Design Bar, or click “Close Design Bar” from the Design Bar drop down menu.

From the NedGraphics Icon in the Design Bar, you can find your software’s license
information under “License manager”. Here you can find your software’s key and any proxy
information. If you see a red message at top that says “License Not Active” and the License
Key numbers are all zeros, please contact us to reactivate your software. A deactivated
license could also be the result of lost internet connection or license expiry. Check your
internet connection and try activating the license again on the module for a quick fix.

By clicking any one of the icon buttons below, you can launch the NedGraphics modules. You
can also have more than one open at any time. To close the module, simply click the icon
again, or close out from the upper corner of the module itself.

The Quick Transformation Tools allow the user to easily apply transformations to art.
Click the to expand or contract the Quick Transformation options on the tool bar. The Quick
Transformation Tools will not activate until a piece of art is created and selected with the
selection tool.

You can also edit the pattern’s scale, rotation
or position by using the Tilde “~” key.
To change the scale, tap the “S” key and hold
“SHIFT+~” while clicking and dragging the
pattern.
To change the rotation, tap the “R” key and
hold “~” while clicking and dragging around
the pattern.

The Quick Color tools allow the user to create swatches of a color from quarter tones three
shades lighter and three shades darker than the original selected color. You can select a color
directly from the swatch library or color palette, or by directly selecting an art object.
With a color selected, click the     button to refresh the tool and generate tones. If “Add
Swatch” is checked, tones will automatically be added to the swatch library when they are
clicked on.

The Quick Raster Utility Tools allow for cropping and recoloring raster images in Illustrator.
To activate the Raster Utility functions, place a raster image into an Illustrator document.
Important: When placing your image, make sure to uncheck the “Link” box, or embed the
image after it is placed.

The      button allows you to crop a raster image in Illustrator. Instead of creating a clipping
mask, this tool will delete all the pixels outside of the selected area to help make your file
much easier to manage and keep your file size down.To crop your image, draw a shape over
or behind the area that you wish to crop, the order of the vector shape and image will not
affect how the crop tool works. Next, select both the raster image and the vector shape.

You can crop out multiple pieces by using more than one shape and selecting all of the
objects before clicking the Raster Utility Crop Tool. Once the image has been cropped in
multiple locations, these pieces become separate images that can be moved and arranged
independently of each other.

The second option under the Raster Utility group allows you to recolor a raster image using
colors from your Swatch Menu. This feature works great for heathers and other fabric
textures you want to simulate and recolor for your fashion sketches.

With the image selected hold the Command Button on a Mac or the Control Button on a PC
and start clicking different colors in your Swatch Menu that you would like to change your
image color to.

In your Swatch Menu, you will find a new folder called “NedGraphics Templates” with new
swatches of your image, recolored in the swatches you had previously selected.
You can drag any of the new swatches out of the Swatch Menu and drop it onto your
document if you would like to continue to use a raster image. You can also use these new
colorized swatches to fill shapes or objects.

The final tools located on the Design Bar are the Quick Dimension Tools. If you do not see
the above three icons at the end of your Design Bar you can turn them on by clicking the
NedGraphics Icon and checking the option for Quick Dimension Tools (the 5th option down
on the list).

The units used for the rulers and dimensions are the same as used in the document. To
change the unit type, show your Rulers (Cmd+R on Mac, Ctrl+R on PC) and right-click or
Ctrl-click onto the rulers. Choose which units you would like to display.

You can remove the rulers and dimension lines by clicking either of the buttons on the Design
Bar again.

The last button on the Design Bar is the Crop Mark Icon. It will apply crop marks on Repeat
art when the fill size is turned on. You can change the length, thickness and color of the crop
marks under the NedGraphics Icon -> Preferences -> Crop Mark Options.

To change the color, select a fill color
Picker and press the Colorize button.

You can use the “Convert to Swatches” function to automate taking multiple artwork files
and making them into Illustrator swatches with just a few clicks. First, place all the files
that you want to convert into a folder together. They can be any file type. Then click the
Design Bar drop down menu and select “Import Files as Swatches.” Click Open an select the
files you wish to import. You can change the scale of the artwork from the scale dropdown
beforehand. The files will automatically be resized to the set scale and added into the
Illustrator Swatches box together.
