# Colorist for Adobe Illustrator

System Compatibilities:
Windows 10 (64 bit) Version 20H2 or higher, or macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher.

Colorist can be used in conjunction with Weave, Repeat, Knit, Geo, Fashion Sketch or any
vector art you’ve created in Illustrator- tor outside of our tools. To open the Colorist Tool, go
to Window > NedGraphics > Colorist or by clicking the           button on the Design Bar.

Select the artwork with the Selection Tool (black arrow) and press the “+” button at the
top right in the Colorist Window. You will see color chips appear below your artwork and a
thumbnail of your design will appear in the Colorways Window.

The first colorway will be named “Original” and it can not be edited. To start making new
colorways, you can press the “+” again to create “Colorway 1” and make changes to the
colors.

Icon View.

The color chips added to the bottom of your screen are arranged at random. If you would like
to arrange the color chips in a specific order without affecting the position in the artwork,
you can select your color chip and use the buttons to move them side to side in order. You
can select more than one chip to move at a time.

A few color positions are redundant in this particular artwork, so we can remove them.
Rather than deleting, we will simply merge them together by using the arrows to physically
push the chips next to each other, then selecting both chips to merge and clicking “Merge”
under the Chip section of the Colorways Tab.

Moving the color chips on the page does not affect the artwork itself. If you want to flip color
positions inside the art, select the chips you want to flip and click the “Flip” button.

To start changing the colors in your artwork to colors that are not currently being used,
simply select the color chip you would like to change with the Selection Tool (black arrow).
Then, select a new color from the Illustrator Swatches menu or the Fill Box on Illustrators
Toolbar. The color chip will change as well as the color in your artwork.

Note: Palette Utility can be used here to push color palettes created in Palette Manager into
the file.

Click the “+” button to create Colorway 2. Each time you click the “+” button, you’re
essentially creating a copy of the previous colorway. If the next colorway you want to create
is more similar to the Original then Colorway 1, then select the Original Colorway before
clicking “+” to duplicate it.

First, select a main color chip to change to a gradient. On Illustrator’s Main Tool Bar, just
below the Fill Box, click the gradient swatch to turn the main color chip into a black and
white gradient. Open Illustrator’s Gradient Panel to make changes to the gradient, such as
radial vs linear and adding additional colors.

New vector art and colors can be added to your colorway at any time. Simply paste, move or
draw your new motif where you would like it to be in the design and click the ADD button.

The new color of the added vector art will be
added to the end of the main chips and the
element can be recolored the same way as the
rest of the design. Selecting a color chip and
clicking the REMOVE button will delete it from
list of color chips. The color position in your
artwork will remain after pushing the REMOVE
button, to delete it, you can select and pressing
the Delete key.

Along the left side of the Colorist Window, you’ll see a series of tabs that will bring up
different options for your colorways. The first tab we’ll take a look at it is the Random Tab.
You can manually change your color chips to make new colorways, but if you have a palette
built and running out of ideas, using the Random Tab to shuffle around multiple colorways
might be a great way for you to come up with new colorways you wouldn’t have previously
thought of.

When you switch to the Random Tab, you can immediately start pressing the button and
you will see the colors of your design shuffle. Important Note: Your colorways are not saved
every time you click the Random button. If you like a colorway that is generated, switch back
to the Colorist Tab and click the “+” button and then go back to the Random Tab to generate
new options.

in your design.

With multiple swatches selected, press the SET button in the Colorist Window. If you would
only like to use the swatches you have selected and not the colors already being used in the
design, check the “Use Swatches Only” check box. Now start, clicking the RANDOM button
and your selected swatches will start shuffling around in your design. You can clear out the
swatches you set by pressing the CLEAR button.

Select the main color chip or chips you would like to keep in place. Press the LOCK button.
Now each time that you click the RANDOM button the position you locked will remain the
same while the other positions shuffle with the swatches you set previously.

If you would like to unlock the position to start randomizing it again, simply click the
UNLOCK button.

The Layout Tab will allow you to change the size, spacing, and layout of your color chips.
You can move your set of chips where ever you would like in your document, but if you
manually try to scale or order your chips, they will revert back to the way Colorist has set
them up. The best way to change the size and order is through the Colorist Window.

You can add additional rows or columns to
your main chip layout by using the drop down
menus in the “Rows and Cols” section. The
Height and Width fields will change the size of
your chips. You can use the drop down menus
to select a new size or type in a new size of
your own in the field. The S. Height field is
the height of your sub chip. The width of your
sub chip is determined by the width of your
main chips. The V.gap and H.gap fields are the
space between your chips.

The Show Tab gives you options to display automated information to your document. You
can check any/all the boxes that you would like to include in your final presentation. The first
three options deal with your chips. You can turn off your main chips, the sub chips or add a
slash through your chip.

The next four options add the swatch name and color information set in Palette Manager to
your chips.

The last group adds all of the file information above your artwork. Try clicking through the
different options to see what is most useful for you.

Instead of having to use the Layout and Show tab every time you create new artwork and
make colorways, you can use the Template Tab to create a uniform way of presenting your
artwork and simply apply that template to your new designs each time.

To get started, click the “+” button in the top-right corner of the Colorist Window. This
will launch a new file called “Template.ai” and it is what you will use to create your artwork
template.

By default, we put our logo and two extra lines of text. You can delete or change these
elements the same way you would any other type or vector element in Illustrator.

You can copy and paste your logo into the template file and add any additional text fields
or draw in any shapes or lines to form your letterhead. The Artwork Here box is where your
design is going to be placed. We recommend scaling this box to the size of the artwork you
are going to be applying it to so you’ll have a better idea on how the layout will turn out after
you apply the template to your design.

Your artwork is not going to be scaled to the proportion of the Artwork Here box when it is
applied. Instead, it will be placed in the upper left hand corner and maintain its size.
The space between the main color chips and the Artwork Here box is the space that will be
maintained when you apply the template to your design. If your design is bigger or smaller
than the Artwork Here box, the chips will move up or down to maintain that space.
Select the Artwork Here box and use Illustrator’s Transform Window to match the scale of
your design. Then move the box and the color chips in the position you think looks best for
your layout.

Switching over to the Show Tab in the Colorist Window, you can add the automated
information you would always like to display on each new design. This information will be
updated each time the template is applied to a new design. You can change the font size and
type for any of the Show information.

You can also use the Quick Dimension or Quick Ruler tool on the Design Bar to add your
dimensions. It will add dimensions to the entire Artwork Here box, but when you apply the
template to a Repeat, Knit, or Woven design, the dimensions will scale only the repeat size.

After saving your template, you will see a thumbnail of it in the Colorist Window. By default
the naming convention for templates is “Template” and then Template1, 2, etc.

You can change the name of your template by double-clicking on the name and typing in a
new one. Click anywhere on the screen to apply the name change. We recommend creating a
template for each page size that you typically present your artwork on and including that size
in the name. It’s also helpful to include the “Artwork Here” box size in the template name so
you know what to set as the fill size on the Repeat, Weave, or Knit modules before applying
a template. In this example, we named the template 6x6” (representing artwork here box) A4
(representing the artboard size).

To apply your template to a new design, simply select the template thumbnail in the Colorist
Window and click the         button. You should see your layout change to your template
layout. If you feel like you need to edit the template to move any of the elements or change
any of the Show or Layout options, click the        button. This will launch the Template.ai file
again and you can make any necessary changes. Click the         button when you are finished
and the button to apply the template changes to your design.

If you save your file, all the colorways are stored within the AI file and the individual
colorways can only be accessed through the Colorist Window. Another user without the
Plug-in would be able to open the file, but they wouldn’t be able to see the other colorways.
Luckily, we have a button that will generate all your colorways on their own artboard in a new
document. This file will operate as a normal AI file that any one with Illustrator can open and
use. In the Swatch Library, there will be pattern swatches of each colorway.

To get started, select all of the colorways in Colorist Window that you would like to present.
It’s not necessary to apply a template before presenting, but doing so will ensure each
Colorway looks cohesive.

Next, click the   button. Depending on how many colorways
you had selected, Illustrator will take some time to create a new
document. You should see all of your colorways laid out exactly
the way you set them up with the Layout and Show Tabs on their
own art board. At the top of the page, the file should be “(Your File
Name)_All- Colorways.ai” You can save this file and send it out for
production or use it to print all of the colorways you would like to
present for approval.

Another bonus is that all your pattern swatches for each colorway is in your Swatch Library,
so you can grab them all here and start filling in your sketches if you need to.

The Show Weave Technical Data will present an art board with all Numeric Info of the current
weave on it if checked when presenting colorways. Check this box and go back to the
Colorways tab to select final colorways and hit “Present All.”

Numeric info includes all color chips with
letters assigned to each, Color Bar values
with corresponding colors, Thread Bar values
and Pattern Bar values.

In addition to the technical data and warp and weft bar options in the Weave section of the
Show tab, you can also call out color chips based upon if they are in the warp or weft color
positions. Like the other options, this will only effect the presentation file.

sections.

The Region Tab will give you the option to present multiple colorways on a single sheet of
paper. This works great if you have large designs and would like to just print a small portion
of it in multiple colorways for approvals.
like to isolate.

You can set your region up as a template so you do
not have to draw a rectangle each time you create
new artwork. Once you have set a region area, click
the “+” button to create a template of your region.
The name of your template will be “Region_(the
dimension of your region)_on_(the size of your art
board).” To delete a region template, select it and
click the “X” button. To apply the region to new
artwork, select it and click the check mark button.
When you are done with the region, you can
uncheck the Show Region check box. The region
rectangle will disappear. Checking the Show Region
check box will bring it back.

Once the region is set, switch back to the Colorist Tab and select multiple colorways. Next,
click the    button. A new window will pop up that will allow you to set how the regions will
be placed on the page. If all of the regions of each colorway will fit on the current art board
size, you can click the Use One Page check box and click OK.

Illustrator will create a new document with the region you isolated in each colorway. The
colorway will be listed at the top of each region with the color chips and color names placed
underneath.

Note: You can go to the Show tab and choose the following options to apply to any region
export you do:
-Color Name -Provider Name -Color Code -Other Color Data
The Date and Filename will be presented to the top left corner of the document(s), while the
Colorway name will rename above the swatches and all color names will present below the
chips.

The Separations Tab is where you will go to create color separation files for your design.
Simply select the design you would like to create separations for and pick how many colors
you would like to appear on the page. The Full Size check box determines whether the
preview of your design that is added to the first page of the separations is at full scale or
just a thumbnail. Click the GENERATE button and Illustrator will create a new file with your
separations.

You can hide color chips that you do not want to show on the presentation file. These color
chips, however, will remain visible in your working colorway file.

In this example, the plaid is a true woven, so we don’t want the mill attempting to print
anything besides the star print.

To hide color chips, select the chips you want to hide and click on the “Hide” button in the
Chip Options section of the Colorist tool. “Hide for all Colorways” will hide that chip position
i all of the existing colorways. Hitting “Reset” will clear out the hidden color chips and reset

In the presented file, the plaid pattern swatch color chip that
was hidden is not presented, and the other color chips are still
shown. “Hide for all Colorways” will hide that chip position in
all of the existing colorways. Hitting “Reset” will clear out the
hidden color chips and reset back to it’s previous setting.

To export a copy of the artwork colorways, set the resolution that you would like the file
to be exported at, choose the file type of png or jpeg, and click the export arrow button. A
finder window will open, asking you to set a destination for the exported files. If “export on
presentation” is checked, you will be asked to choose an export destination every time

1. Be aware of having the Fill Box on top of the Stroke Box in your tool bar when changing
        the colors of your art.
2. If your color chips are not displaying properly, delete them by selecting them all with the
        black arrow and hitting the delete key on the keyboard. Then clicking on the Original
        colorway. Go back to the one that was displaying incorrectly and start working again.
3. Color chips only need to be clicked on once to edit colors; double-clicking the chips will
        put them into isolation mode and the new chosen color will not apply to the artwork.
        Double-click again to release isolation mode. That can also be turned off in Illustrator
        Preferences under the General tab.
4. Make sure to use the Show, Layout and Template tabs before presenting artwork for 		
        additional information to be added to the final pages
5. You can merge all chips that are created off of one Spot Color and have all the tonal sub
        chips underneath the one main chip.
6. Sub chips are the smaller color chips created on all spot colors, gradients and patterns.
        If the patterns and gradients are vector based they can be used to recolor the pattern
        or gradient within the colorway. If they are solid colors, (i.e. Pantone) you can use the
        tint slider to pick a percentage of the shade and maintain it in all colorways
7. The Merge button under Chip Options will only merge 2 color chips at a time and will 		
        merge to the left most chip in the order.
8. Use the arrows in the Chip Options section to rearrange the order of the color chips. Do
        this on “Colorway 1” to keep the same order in all colorways.
9. Add in vector elements by selecting them and pressing the “Add” button in the Art Options
        section. Remove vector elements by selecting it and pressing the Remove button and
        then deleting them from the artwork.
10. Text and Symbols can be added into the art, and will produce color chips of any strokes,
        fills or patterns they contain.
11. Make sure when using a template that the artwork has been added to Colorist first in the
        Colorways tab otherwise it will not apply the template to the current document.
