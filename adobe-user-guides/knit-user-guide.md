# Knit for Adobe Illustrator

System Compatibilities:
Windows 10 (64 bit) Version 20H2 or higher, or macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher.

The Knit Tool will help you create simulated knit designs with realistic stitch textures. To
open the Knit Tool window, go to Window > NedGraphics > Knit, or click the button on

the Design Bar.

I don’t remember what this does.

When creating knit designs, it’s important to start in a brand new document. Open the Knit
module and choose your view mode. Color Chart stitches will look like solid rectangles,
Shaded will look like realistic stitches, and Flat will show solid vector shaped stitches with a

Choose your fill color first then select the Knitting Tool      from Illustrator’s Main Tool Bar.
This is the tool you will use to draw all of your stitches. Click on the page and hold the Alt
key while dragging the cursor across at an angle to create a repeat tile just outside the art

The “Color Count” section lets you see how many colors are used within the design and
calls out how many colors are present in each row of stitches. Type the maximum number
of colors per row into “Max Row Colors” and click “Show Row” to populate the info to the
left of the stitches. Rows with more colors than allowed will be displayed in red. Click “Show
Row” again to take away the info or to refresh the numbers. The total amount of colors
overall will be in the “Total Colors” section below.

Before you start drawing in your design, click the “Create Knit Fill” check box in the Fill Size
section. A duplicate repeat area will be added to the right of the knit tile you drew previously.
Enter in new values in the Width and Height fields to expand the display area to fill your art
board. The Refresh function on the Main tab will also update the color count if the knit has
been edited to reflect the updated number of colors in the knit design. Doing this will help to
keep the file size down and allow for faster recoloring later on.

Select a new color again and start drawing new
motifs. You can hold the Shift key to draw at angles,

the Alt key to draw in boxes or larger bars of color.
You can also just click with the cursor without holding
any keys to freehand draw a motif.

Using the Paint Same Color tool will change the color of touching stitches that are the
same color. If you hold the Alt key and click on a color with the Paint Same Color tool, it will
change every stitch of that color to the new color.

You can continuously add to your repeat tile by either drawing in new elements on the
outside of the tile, or by copy and pasting sections of your design. You can use the Quick
Transformation Tools (Design Bar) to extend the width of your repeat tile. Select the entire
tile and open your Quick Transformation tools by clicking on the       button on the Design

You can copy and paste certain elements of your design to add to the height of your repeat
tile. You can use the Selection Tool (Black Arrow) to select areas you’d like to copy and
paste. To work even faster, click and hold on the button to use the Knit Selection Tools.

The “Select Same Stitch Color” tool works very similarly to the Paint Bucket version. By
clicking on a single stitch, it will select all touching stitches of that color. Holding the “Alt” key
while clicking will select all stitches of that color, regardless if they are touching or not. Once
your piece is selected, switch to the Black Arrow tool and hold down the “Alt + Shift” key to
drag a duplicate of that section to the top of your tile. Click the “Refresh” button to add the
new stitches to your design. Now you will be able to recolor more areas of your design.

Dropper to reuse a color in your design,
Illustrator’s Eye Dropper tool will pick up all the different shades of your “Shaded” stitches. If you use the Knit Eye Dropper Tool it will pick the exact swatch used to color that specific areas of your design.

You can swatch the entire knit design or just a selection of the stitches to be used as pattern
swatches in other files. When you create a swatch of your knit design, the swatch is placed
in the Illustrator Swatches box as a pattern swatch and can be used as a pattern in your flat
sketches for garments, accessories, or to show different versions of the pattern in a larger
area. Click the button to create swatches of the designs.

In the previous section, we built a fair isle pattern using a basic knit stitch. You also have the
option to build knit patterns with special stitches like cables, arans, and laces. Designing with
these stitches works best in “Shaded” View Mode.

The stitches are made with Illustrator Symbols.
We’ve added a few different libraries full of
specialty stitches in Illustrator as part of our install. To access these libraries, open your

Symbols Library and click on the Symbol Menu
button in the top-right corner of the window and then navigate to Open Symbol Library > NedGraphics Knits. You can look through each of the libraries to see all the different options you have to work with. To start, open the Basics library. There are two options, the regular knit stitch and a purl stitch. Click the

purl stitch to add it to your Symbols library.

Next we will pick the cable stitches we would like to use in our design. Click on the Symbols
Menu button again and navigate to Open Symbols Library > NedGraphics Knit > Cables.
If the symbols are displayed in Thumbnail View, click on the Symbols Menu button on the
Cables Library and change the view to either Small List View or Large List View to see the
title of each cable stitch. We have included the dimensions of each stitch in the title by stitch
width x stitch heights. For example:

You may use multiple stitch types to make your design, but in order to make sure your design
lines up to repeat vertically, you will want to look at the last number in the name and make
sure it is divisible with the other stitches you are using in your design.

With your all of your special stitches added to your Symbol Library, select the first stitch type
you would like to use. Use the Knitting Tool       and hold the Shift key to draw a straight
vertical line just outside of the bottom left corner of your art board.

Cable stitches always look best with a row of purl stitches on each side to help them stand
out. In your Symbols Library, select the purl stitch. Use the Knitting Tool to draw a row of
purl stitches on either side of your cable row.

Note: To get your design to repeat, in your purl rows leave a blank space near the top next to
the teeth of your cable stitches and draw your row of purls next to the bottom teeth of your
cable stitch like the example below.

Select a new Cable Stitch in your Symbols Library and use the Knitting Tool to draw
additional rows on your repeat tile. The design should automatically update with each new
row of cable stitches in your repeat area. If it does not, simply click the REFRESH button.

With a block of your cable stitches selected, switch over the Black Arrow Selection Tool in
Illustrator’s Main Tool Bar. Hold the Option + Shift keys and click and drag your selection
to the left to duplicate it. Line it up as close as you can to the edge of your design and then
click the REFRESH button to add the duplicated area to your design.

The last tab in the Knit Tool window is called the Converter Tab. This function will allow you
to convert any raster or vector artwork into knit stitches.

To start, either open an AI file with some vector art OR place a rasterized image in a new AI
document. Set your Stitch and Row Gauge sizes and click on the Converter Tab.

The artwork you have selected will pixelate based on the sizes you entered earlier for your
Stitch and Row Gauge. If you are not happy with the way your image has pixelated, you
can always click on the image and Undo the function (Cmd+Z for Mac, Ctrl+Z for PC). You
can either resize your image or change the settings for the Stitch and Row Gauge and try to
preview the image again.

1. Choose your Fill color before drawing your artwork.
2. Use the REFRESH button at any time to make sure your artwork is in line with the knit grid
and to add artwork that you have copied and pasted to your design.
3. You can use Color Chart View Mode and utilize a grid to help draw your fair isle repeat.
You can switch View Modes at any time if you’d like to print in Shaded View 				
Mode for presentations.
4. You can select specific areas of your design and use the SWATCH button to make a 		
pattern swatch of the selection.
5. Use the “Create Knit Fill” option to show a greater area of your stitches rather than 		
drawing the entire design out.
