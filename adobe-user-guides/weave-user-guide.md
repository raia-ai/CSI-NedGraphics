# Weave for Adobe Illustrator

System Compatibilities:
Windows 10 (64 bit) Version 20H2 or higher, or macOS Catalina (10.15) or higher.

Weave is used to create woven patterns such as stripes and plaids. You can draw your
patterns out by using the Tool Options Tab and the Add Elements Tool or you can switch
to the Numeric Design Tab and enter in the values of your pattern to create it. To open the
Weave Tool, click the      button on the Design Bar.

Weave Tool, click the      button on the Design Bar.

Before you start drawing your pattern, check the Thread Count in the “Thread Properties”
section. The lower the number, the thicker the threads. To change the Thread Count, type in
a new number and press the ENTER button. If you do not know the Thread Count, you can
leave it at “100” and edit it later.

To draw in new color positions, change your Fill Color.

Use the Add Elements Tool draw in the new color positions. You may notice that you can
draw with your cursor above or below the Color Bar and the new positions will always draw
into the Color Bar.

Continue to change your Fill Color and add as many positions as needed.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to uncheck the Draw Thread Bars and the Draw Pattern Bars check
boxes in the Tool Options Tab if your pattern has the same weave structure and thread
count in the entire repeat. If you leave them checked while drawing your new color positions,
it will also add new positions in your Thread Bar and Pattern Bar causing the file to include
unneeded elements, which will increase file size. If you want the Thread Bar and Pattern Bar
broken up as well, keep all three checked.

If you would like to use the same size color bar in multiple positions, you can copy and paste
a position by using the following steps:

to it.

You can also merge multiple color positions that are next to each other into one piece. The
color of the furthest left color position selected will be the color for the merged piece. To
merge positions, follow these steps:

Inversely, you can also split existing bars into
smaller pieces by using the Snip tool on the main
toolbar in AI. Click on the icon by clicking and
holding on the Select Element tool and selecting
the “Split Element” tool.

You can draw out your Weft Bars the same way that you just drew your Warp Bars. However,
if the Warp is the same design as the Weft, you can use the Warp to Weft button in the
Property Elements section of the Weave Tool to instantly copy the bars over.

If at anytime you would like to adjust the scale of your entire Warp and/or Weft bar, you can
adjust it in the Scale section of the Weave Tool Window. Check which bar you would like
to adjust the scale of and then type in the scale percentage you would like to adjust the bar
to. 100% is the current scale of the bars. A number higher than 100% will expand the scale
of your bars, a number lower than 100% will decrease the scale of your bars. Type in the
percentage you would like to apply to your bars and press the ENTER key. You will see the
scale of the bars you have checked changed to the new scale.

15%.

screen.

The plaid is generated based on your Thread Count and Pattern selected. By default, the
Thread Count for both the Warp and Weft is 100 and the Pattern used is a Plain Weave
pattern. You can change these two elements at any time. To change the thread count,
select the Thread Bar in the Warp Bars (the second bar with vertical grey stripes). In the
Weave Tool Window, type in the new Thread Count number you would like to change to and
press the ENTER key to apply the changes. You should see the stripes in your Thread Bar
adjust slightly. Click the Generate button to apply the changes in your plaid.

To change the Thread Count in the Weft Bars, follow the same steps as above. Select the
Thread Bar in the Weft Bars and type in your new Thread Count. You can type the same
number that was used in the Warp Bars or a different number. After pressing the ENTER key
to apply your changes, click the Generate button to apply the changes to your plaid.

Note: When you click the Generate button for the first time, there will be 3 new patterns that
get added to your Swatch Library. The first two are the patterns for your Thread Bar and
Pattern Bar. Never delete these from your Swatch Library. The last pattern is a repeatable
fill pattern of your plaid. Each time you click the Generate button, this pattern swatch will be
updated.

You can change the default Plain Weave pattern at anytime as well. We’ve included a large
library of pre-made patterns that you can open from your Swatch Library. Click on the
Swatch Library Menu button at the top right corner of the Swatch Library Window. Hover
your mouse over Open Swatch Library and then NedGraphics Weaves. We have a list of
different types of Weave Patterns you can browse through.

Note: The pattern placed in the Pattern Bar may seam out of scale at first, but don’t worry.
Once you click the GENERATE button, the pattern will automatically adjust itself to the
correct size according to your thread count.

You may notice the Pattern Bar in the Weft Bars is left as a solid color. This acts more of a
placeholder since the pattern only needs to be applied to one of the two bars. If you have
pattern that need to go into the weft, you can draw into it with the add element tool and
Draw Pattern Bar checked on the Weave tool or add it by using Numeric Design options.

Select a new pattern and start drawing in new positions on either Pattern Bar with the Add
Element Tool. Once you are finished, click the GENERATE button to see the new weave
pattern areas applied to your woven design.

To avoid having a mis-step in the repeat of the weave pattern, turn on the Draw Pattern
guide. This creates a blue line guide that will show you where your current pattern will end.
First, you must choose the pattern you want to use by selecting the pattern swatch from
the weave libraries or by clicking the pattern that you created in the Illustrator swatch panel.
Then click the “Set Pattern” button in the Tool Options box.

Make sure “Show Pattern Guide” is checked to see the guide. It will automatically check the
thread and pattern bars. Start drawing onto the file and it will show you an active guide of
where to end your repeat and have the pattern fill in evenly.

If you can’t find a pattern in our library that simulates a weave pattern you are trying to make,
you can create your own pattern and apply it to your design.

In the Illustrator Main Tool Bar, select the Draw Pattern Tool.       Your cursor will turn into
a larger grid with cross hairs in the center. Each time you click your cursor, you will create
a black box for the pattern. The grid cursor will help you line up your pattern and create a
repeat. If your boxes are not lined up, select them all and click the “Snap to Grid” button in
the Pattern Construction Tool section of the Construction tab.

Continue adding the black boxes until you
have a repeatable pattern drawn out.

Select the pattern you just drew and drag
Swatch Pattern out of it.

Select the Pattern Bar you would like to change and click on your new Swatch Pattern in your
Swatch Library to change it. Click the generate button and you will see your new pattern
applied to your weave design.

You can also dictate which part of the structure goes to the weft color and which goes to
the warp within the weave structure. When creating the structure with the Draw Pattern tool,
hold SHIFT to create white boxes. These will be the weft color. Hold the ALT/OPTION key
to make a transparent box. Transparent boxes are treated like a lace or hole when used in
the pattern bar or as a dobby on top of the generated weave. If you draw out a structure and
realize it is too small, you can also double the size by selecting the boxes and clicking the
“Double” button.
       USING THE CONSTRUCTION TAB CONTINUED...

To add a dobby texture to the weave, use the Draw Pattern tool to create
your dobby on top of the generated plaid pattern. The dobby must be made within the repeat
of the weave. To keep the plaid from moving while editing the dobby art, select the plaid
swatch and hold Cmnd(Mac) or Cntrl (PC) +2 to lock it.

After you’ve drawn the dobby, select the art and click the ALIGN button under the “To
Thread” section of the Weave tool to line up the dobby to the closest thread.

To see the dobby within the generated plaid, select the dobby and click the PUSH button
under the “Dobby” section of the Weave tool.

to pull out the art one at a time.

The Plaid.

        USING THE CONSTRUCTION TAB CONTINUED...
If the dobby is drawn on top of the generated weave, the boxes will be drawn at the current
thread size. If you have created the structure to the side of the generated plaid though, the
boxes may not be the same size as your thread count. Selecting the dobby and clicking the
SCALE button under the “To Thread” section will resize the dobby to the thread count of the
section it’s placed onto.

If you need to draw a plaid with positions that are a specific measurement, you can switch
over to the Numeric Tab in the Weave Tool Window in order to type out your woven design.
To start, change the Unit drop down box to the form of measurement you would like to use.
Then type in the size of each of your color positions and make sure to separate each of the
positions with a comma.

      DRAWING WITH THE NUMERIC TAB CONTINUED...
With the Select Element Tool, click on one of the color positions in the Warp Bar. You should
see all the color positions matching that color in the Warp Bar selected. Now you can select a
new color you would like to change these positions to.

Use the Select Element Tool, to select each color in the Warp and Weft Bars to recolor all of
the positions. You can add your Weft Bars the same way you entered in your Warp Bars, or
you can still use the Copy Warp To Weft Button.

With the Select Element Tool, click on one of the color positions in the Warp Bar. You should
see all the color positions matching that color in the Warp Bar selected. Now you can select a
new color you would like to change these positions to.

Use the Select Element Tool to select each color in the Warp and Weft Bars to recolor all of
the positions.

With all of your color positions recolored, click “Generate” to create your weave design.

      DRAWING WITH THE NUMERIC TAB CONTINUED...
You can quickly edit a color position size (whether you created your weave in the Numeric
Tab or used the Add Elements Tool to draw it) by selecting the position and using the
Element Details section. The position you have selected will be highlighted in the length field.
Type in a new value and hit Enter. This will extend/shrink the bar on the file. Hit “Generate”
to see the changes render in the swatch.

Note: Have the Enable Length Change box checked to automatically engage the length
section when typing in values. Uncheck this box to keep keyboard shortcuts available while
working with weaves and making selections of elements on the file.

Every time you have generated your weave design so far, the size of the design is only
displayed by the width and height of the repeat. If you would like to fill the rest of your
artboard and expand the area of your design beyond the repeat, look in the “Fill Size” area of
the Weave Tool Window.

Check the “Use Fill Size” check box. The fields for Width and Height will activate and the size
of your repeat will be listed in each field. Next, type in the expanded width you would like for
your weave design to be displayed at. Press the ENTER key and you should see your design
expand to that new width. Type in the expanded height you would like to apply to your
design and press the ENTER key. The units will follow the current document units of this file.

The Show Dimensions check box will show the size call-out for each color bar in the unit set
to the AI document. The box next to it will determine the font size of the text placed on the
file. If it overlaps where the stripes are smaller, lower the font value to decrease the size of
the text.

update the units.

1. Always work in a brand new .AI document. Make sure to embed any .jpegs or raster images
you may be using in your document.
2. The Generate button must always be used to apply any changes made to your design.
3. You can draw your warp and weft bars anywhere on the Illustrator canvas, not just on the
artboard.
4. Images placed in the document that are used to trace from will show on top of a generated
weave initially. Move images away from the generated weave to see the full pattern.
5. You can have different Thread Counts in the warp and weft by selecting each Thread Bar
and changing the Thread Count.
6. You can fill your color bars with vector or raster patterns to simulate different textures.
7. When building dobbies on top of the weave, use Cmnd/Cntrl +2 to lock the weave or 		
select it and Object >Lock > Selection.
8. Turn the GPU off in AI Preferences on Weave files to avoid odd rendering and color 		
discrepancies of the swatch on the file.
9. Keep all pattern swatches used in the weave in the Swatches panel and save the file with
them as well.
