To start creating a repeat pattern with the Repeat Tool, open an AI file with vector motifs
and open the Repeat Tool with the button on the Design Bar. If you know the size of the
roller the print maker will be using, you can select it from the Roller drop-down menu.

your print maker uses, you can select any Repeat Size in the Repeat drop-down menu or just
draw a box (background tile) using Illustrator’s Rectangle Tool

The Create button will automatically add a solid black square behind your motifs. This square
will be the repeat tile you work with and will also serve as your print’s background color. You
can change the color of this square by selecting it and picking a new color.

Move the square to the far right of your motifs. When you start the repeat process the square
will tile around itself, and you’ll want to have some space between the tiles and your motifs.

Next, choose how many repeat sections you want visible in the Copies drop-down menu.

dimensions will be placed on the outside of your repeat tile. If you created a repeat with a

artwork and release the clipping mask around it.
After clicking the Release button, you will be asked
if you are sure you want to create a duplicate as

non-repeat art. Click the “Yes” button.

The duplicated artwork will serve as regular vector
art that can not be edited with the Start and Stop button.

1. As a designer, you may not want to use the repeat sizes provided in the software. If you
want to create a custom repeat size you can draw a rectangle at any size you want and then
start the repeat process on that size background tile.

2. The “Start” button turns into the “Stop” button when the repeat is running.

3. If you lower the opacity of your surrounding repeat area using the “Opacity” functions this
will allow you to see your original motifs more easily.

repeat process, save your artwork and then “Start” the process again. B.) If you send an
element to behind the repeat area and press “Refresh” it will bring it forward in front of the

stops the repeat process, but it will not actually save a usable repeat file. You must stop the

get access to your vector motifs. The original repeat tile will remain live and can be started/
stopped indefinitely.

For easy motif creation, see the next page to learn more about the Geo tool.

The Geo Tool allows you to create medallion or mandala graphics by repeating elements
around a shape.

To start using the Geo Tool, create a new AI document and open the Geo Tool by going
to Window > NedGraphics > Geo or by clicking the button on the Design Bar. In the Geo
window, choose either a square or circle shape. Specify a quantity of sections within your
shape and how many inches you want the shape to be.

You can use any of the drawing tools to draw inside the Geo shape. Start drawing inside
the red lines. The artwork will automatically populate in the other sectors. Continue drawing
between the lines with other colors and other drawing tools to add to your design.

Aside from using the drawing tool, you can use shapes, symbols, brushes, and raster images
in your design. When you are finished with your design, click the STOP button to deactivate
the repeat function of the geo shape. Then, select the geo shape and delete it. The design
will now be released and elements can be adjusted individually.
