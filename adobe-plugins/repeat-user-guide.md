                          USING THE REPEAT TOOL
To start creating a repeat pattern with the Repeat Tool, open an AI file with vector motifs
and open the Repeat Tool with the button on the Design Bar. If you know the size of the
roller the print maker will be using, you can select it from the Roller drop-down menu.



The Repeat drop-down menu gives
you all the different repeat sizes
that will fit on the Roller Size you
have selected.


With your Repeat Size chosen, click the Create button. If you do not know the Roller Size
your print maker uses, you can select any Repeat Size in the Repeat drop-down menu or just
draw a box (background tile) using Illustrator’s Rectangle Tool




The Create button will automatically add a solid black square behind your motifs. This square
will be the repeat tile you work with and will also serve as your print’s background color. You
can change the color of this square by selecting it and picking a new color.

Move the square to the far right of your motifs. When you start the repeat process the square
will tile around itself, and you’ll want to have some space between the tiles and your motifs.

                           USING THE REPEAT TOOL
Next, choose how many repeat sections you want visible in the Copies drop-down menu.
You can adjust the Appearance options whenever you’d like during the process.

                                                      Click the “Start” button and you will see your
                                                      repeat tile duplicated around itself depending
                                                      on the copy chosen in the Copies drop-
                                                      down menu. If you have an Opacity set in the
                                                      Appearance Section, the repeated tiles will be
                                                      displayed at that level of Opacity. The Show
                                                      Border check box will add a dashed border
                                                      around the active tile to create your design
                                                      within.

By default, your repeat will
generate the new tiles in
a Straight Repeat. You can
change how the repeat
tiles are arranged in the
Drop/Shifts Section. Click
through the different
Repeat Type Options to
see how the tiles change.
If you’ve selected either
the Drop or Shift option,
you can change how much
the tiles offset by selecting
a different fraction in the
Offset Drop-down Menu.




Next, choose how many repeat sections you want visible in the Copies drop-down menu.
You can adjust the Appearance options whenever you’d like during the process.
Note: If your adjustments are not visible in the surrounding repeat tiles, you can hit the
“Refresh” button to update the repeat tiles.

                          USING THE REPEAT TOOL
You can also draw directly into the repeat tile with any of the Shape Tools, the Pen Tool, the
Pencil Tool, or the Brush/Blob Tool. When using the Brush Tool, you may have to click on the
Brush path with your Selection Tool to have it generate in your surrounding repeat tiles.




Press the “Stop” button when you are finished with your design. This will stop the repeat
process. Once the repeat is stopped then you can save your artwork. Remember: Stop and
Save.




To add the repeat tile to your Swatch Library, select the artwork with the Selection Tool and
press the “Swatch” button in the Repeats Control section. This will take your existing layout
and add a repeatable tile into the Swatch Library.

When you click the “Stop” button, only the original repeat tile will be displayed. If you would
like to show more of your pattern with the Fill Size section.

                                                                          Check the “Use Fill Size” check

                                                                          Type in a new dimension you
                                                                          would like to display your pattern
                                                                          at in each field, press the ENTER
                                                                          key after typing in your dimension.
                                                                          Your pattern will fill out to the right
                                                                          and top of your repeat tile.




You can apply dimensions to your artwork automatically. On the Design Bar, click either
the ruler icon or the dimension icon and dimensions will be added to your artwork. The
dimensions will be placed on the outside of your repeat tile. If you created a repeat with a
drop or slide, you can check the “Use Repeat Tile Bounds” under the Dimensions section of
the Repeat Window. The dimensions will then show the full repeat including the drop or slide.


You’re all set to print or make
color ways of your design. If
you’d like to make colorways
next, see our manual for the
Colorist Tool and learn how to
easily make multiple colorways
that are all stored within one
file.

Note: If you don’t see the
ruler and dimension tools
on the Design Bar, click on
the NedGraphics Icon on the
Design Bar and check Quick
Dimension Utilities.

                           USING THE REPEAT TOOL
Aside from adding dimensions to your artwork, you can also add crop marks around the
repeat tile by clicking on the  button. You can set the size and color of the crop marks by
clicking on the NedGraphics Icon on the Design Bar and selecting Preferences > Crop Mark
Options.




Stroke width of your crop mark lines. H. Length and V. Length is the length of each line.
Changing the color in your Fill Box and clicking the Colorize button changes the color of the
crop marks.
                                  THE RELEASE FUNCTION
The Release button will create a copy of the repeat
artwork and release the clipping mask around it.
After clicking the Release button, you will be asked
if you are sure you want to create a duplicate as
non-repeat art. Click the “Yes” button.

The original repeat tile will maintain its properties,
meaning you can start and stop the repeat to make
edits at any time.

The duplicated artwork will serve as regular vector
art that can not be edited with the Start and Stop
button.

                             REPEAT TIPS & TRICKS

1. As a designer, you may not want to use the repeat sizes provided in the software. If you
want to create a custom repeat size you can draw a rectangle at any size you want and then
start the repeat process on that size background tile.

2. The “Start” button turns into the “Stop” button when the repeat is running.

3. If you lower the opacity of your surrounding repeat area using the “Opacity” functions this
will allow you to see your original motifs more easily.

4. Roller sizes of 25.25 in or 64.14 cm are the most common sizes used for fashion

5. The “Refresh” button has two functions: A.) If you see that your print is lagging in the
process you can hit the “Refresh” button. If you still see the lagging you can “Stop” the
repeat process, save your artwork and then “Start” the process again. B.) If you send an
element to behind the repeat area and press “Refresh” it will bring it forward in front of the
repeat area.

6. If you try to save the document while the repeat process is still running, it automatically
stops the repeat process, but it will not actually save a usable repeat file. You must stop the
repeat process and then save the document.

7. Use the “Release” button if you need to release the clipping mask around the repeat and
get access to your vector motifs. The original repeat tile will remain live and can be started/
stopped indefinitely.

To start using the Geo Tool, create a new AI document and open the Geo Tool by going
to Window > NedGraphics > Geo or by clicking the button on the Design Bar. In the Geo
window, choose either a square or circle shape. Specify a quantity of sections within your
shape and how many inches you want the shape to be.

                                                                 Press the NEW button and your shape

                             USING THE GEO TOOL
You can use any of the drawing tools to draw inside the Geo shape. Start drawing inside
the red lines. The artwork will automatically populate in the other sectors. Continue drawing
between the lines with other colors and other drawing tools to add to your design.




Aside from using the drawing tool, you can use shapes, symbols, brushes, and raster images
in your design. When you are finished with your design, click the STOP button to deactivate
the repeat function of the geo shape. Then, select the geo shape and delete it. The design
