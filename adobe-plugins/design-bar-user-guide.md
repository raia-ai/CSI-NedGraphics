        USING THE QUICK TRANSFORMATIONS TOOLS

The Quick Transformation Tools allow the user to easily apply transformations to art.
Click the to expand or contract the Quick Transformation options on the tool bar. The Quick
Transformation Tools will not activate until a piece of art is created and selected with the
selection tool.




                                                        With the art selected, you can apply horizontal
                                                        or vertical transformations, as well as
                                                        generating a copy and mirroring the art on the
                                                        x or y axis to create chains or loops.

                                                        To the right of the Quick Transformation
                                                        Tools are two check boxes that control
                                                        whether the transformations will be applied
                                                        to Objects and/or Patterns. If only Pattern
                                                        is checked, only the pattern filled inside the
                                                        selected object will be transformed and the
                                                        object’s orientation will remain as it is.

                   USING THE QUICK COLORS TOOLS
The Quick Color tools allow the user to create swatches of a color from quarter tones three
shades lighter and three shades darker than the original selected color. You can select a color
directly from the swatch library or color palette, or by directly selecting an art object.
With a color selected, click the     button to refresh the tool and generate tones. If “Add
Swatch” is checked, tones will automatically be added to the swatch library when they are
clicked on.




                 You can name a color that is not in the Swatch Menu by clicking on the first
                 color in the Quick Colors module. A box will pop up telling you the RGB
                 value of the color, and will allow you to rename the color.




                  USING THE RASTER UTILITY TOOLS
The Quick Raster Utility Tools allow for cropping and recoloring raster images in Illustrator.
To activate the Raster Utility functions, place a raster image into an Illustrator document.
Important: When placing your image, make sure to uncheck the “Link” box, or embed the
image after it is placed.

                  USING THE RASTER UTILITY TOOLS
                                     RASTER CROP TOOL

The      button allows you to crop a raster image in Illustrator. Instead of creating a clipping
mask, this tool will delete all the pixels outside of the selected area to help make your file
much easier to manage and keep your file size down.To crop your image, draw a shape over
or behind the area that you wish to crop, the order of the vector shape and image will not
affect how the crop tool works. Next, select both the raster image and the vector shape.

                                                              You can utilize Illustrators Shape
                                                              tools or blob brush tool to create
                                                              solid filled shapes. Make sure that
                                                              the shape you create does not
                                                              have any holes or open areas, or
                                                              the crop function will not work
                                                              properly.




You can crop out multiple pieces by using more than one shape and selecting all of the
objects before clicking the Raster Utility Crop Tool. Once the image has been cropped in
multiple locations, these pieces become separate images that can be moved and arranged
independently of each other.

                  USING THE RASTER UTILITY TOOLS
                                RASTER RECOLOR TOOL

The second option under the Raster Utility group allows you to recolor a raster image using
colors from your Swatch Menu. This feature works great for heathers and other fabric
textures you want to simulate and recolor for your fashion sketches.

                                                             To start, place a scan or an image of
                                                             a fabric texture into a new Illustrator
                                                             document. Make sure the image is
                                                             embedded and not linked.




With the image selected hold the Command Button on a Mac or the Control Button on a PC
and start clicking different colors in your Swatch Menu that you would like to change your
image color to.

                                                             Once you have your colors selected,
                                                             press the    button to create new
                                                             swatches of your colorized image. A
                                                             pop-up message will appear stating
                                                             how many new colorized images have
                                                             been added to your Swatch Menu.
                                                             Press the OK button to continue.




In your Swatch Menu, you will find a new folder called “NedGraphics Templates” with new
swatches of your image, recolored in the swatches you had previously selected.
You can drag any of the new swatches out of the Swatch Menu and drop it onto your
document if you would like to continue to use a raster image. You can also use these new
colorized swatches to fill shapes or objects.

                USING THE QUICK DIMENSION TOOLS

The final tools located on the Design Bar are the Quick Dimension Tools. If you do not see
the above three icons at the end of your Design Bar you can turn them on by clicking the
NedGraphics Icon and checking the option for Quick Dimension Tools (the 5th option down
on the list).




                         The first two buttons apply a ruler or dimension lines to your
                         artwork. The rulers/dimensions can be set to repeat tiles, pattern
                         swatches, weaves, and knit patterns and will automatically
                         dimension out their repeat sizes. You can set rulers and dimensions
                         to other vector & raster artwork on a page by selecting all the
                         artwork you like to add them to. If nothing is selected on the page
                         the rulers or dimension lines will apply to the total amount of
                         artwork in the document. If you would like to add rulers/dimensions
                         to a group of objects, group them (Object > Group or Cmd+G)
                         before applying.




The units used for the rulers and dimensions are the same as used in the document. To
change the unit type, show your Rulers (Cmd+R on Mac, Ctrl+R on PC) and right-click or
Ctrl-click onto the rulers. Choose which units you would like to display.

You can remove the rulers and dimension lines by clicking either of the buttons on the Design
Bar again.

                 USING THE QUICK DIMENSION TOOLS
The last button on the Design Bar is the Crop Mark Icon. It will apply crop marks on Repeat

marks under the NedGraphics Icon -> Preferences -> Crop Mark Options.




To change the color, select a fill color
from your Swatch Menu or Color
Picker and press the Colorize button.




                   CONVERTING FILES TO SWATCHES
You can use the “Convert to Swatches” function to automate taking multiple artwork files
and making them into Illustrator swatches with just a few clicks. First, place all the files
that you want to convert into a folder together. They can be any file type. Then click the
Design Bar drop down menu and select “Import Files as Swatches.” Click Open an select the
files you wish to import. You can change the scale of the artwork from the scale dropdown
beforehand. The files will automatically be resized to the set scale and added into the
Illustrator Swatches box together.
