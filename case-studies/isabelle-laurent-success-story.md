Isabelle-Laurent-Style: Elevating Textile
Design with NedGraphics
A Legacy of Creativity and Innovation

Founded in 2002, Isabelle-Laurent-Style is the brainchild of Isabelle Laurent, a seasoned textile designer specializing in home decor, including bed linens,
tablecloths, and wallpapers. After years of leading a major printing fabrics factory, Isabelle Laurent faced a pivotal moment when it shut down in 2001. Instead of
stepping away from the world of textile design, she embraced the opportunity to build something of her own. In 2002, Isabelle-Laurent-Style was born, a design
studio dedicated to crafting exquisite patterns for home decor.

With an eye for intricate details and a passion for timeless designs, she knew that success as a freelancer required more than just artistic talent—it demanded
efficiency, precision, and the right tools to bring her creations to life. But where could she find software that matched her expertise and evolving needs?

Precision and Efficiency: The Demands of an Independent Designer
As an independent designer, Isabelle faced the challenge of handling every aspect of her work—design creation, color separation, pattern composition, and
printing preparation—all while maintaining high quality and efficiency. She needed a software solution that was specialized for textile design rather than generic
photo editing tools. Additionally, the ability to work with older file formats was crucial to ensuring continuity in her extensive portfolio.

How NedGraphics Became Isabelle’s Go-To Design Software
For Isabelle, choosing NedGraphics felt like a natural progression in her career, as her journey with NedGraphics began long before she founded her studio,
influencing her approach to digital textile design and solidifying her trust in its capabilities. When she set out to build something of her own, the choice was clear—
she already had the perfect tool at her fingertips. NedGraphics had been a constant in her career, evolving alongside her creative process. Year after year, she
embraced each new upgrade, ensuring her work remained innovative, efficient, and ready for the ever-changing demands of the industry.

NedGraphics solutions, including Design & Repeat, Easy Coloring, and Color Reduction & Cleaning, seamlessly support Isabelle’s creative process. She starts with
hand-drawn designs, scans them, and uses Color Reduction & Cleaning to separate colors. In Design & Repeat, she refines patterns and prepares them for
printing, while Easy Coloring allows her to create multiple color variations effortlessly. Additionally, NedGraphics’ ability to handle engraver files ensures she can
work with traditional printers without losing vital information.

Beyond its powerful tools, NedGraphics provides fast and reliable customer support, giving Isabelle immediate solutions whenever she encounters technical
challenges.

Seamless Design and Unmatched Efficiency: A Game-Changer for Isabelle’s Creative Workflow
With NedGraphics, Isabelle has sustained her creative process over the years. With NedGraphics, she continues to refine her workflow, working faster while
reducing time and costs with advanced tools for checks, stripes, ikat, and intricate pattern structures. The software’s specialized tools ensure her design workflow
is seamless, maintaining the precision needed for wallpaper and textile prints.

More than just a tool, NedGraphics has been a long-standing partner in her journey—one she cannot imagine working without. It has helped her sustain her artistic
integrity while enhancing her efficiency, making it an essential asset for her work as a freelance designer in the textile and wallpaper industry.

       "I always recommend NedGraphics to other freelance designers
       because its different tools are specially adapted for pattern design.
       It’s not just software—it’s my creative engine."
