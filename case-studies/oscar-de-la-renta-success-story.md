One of the greatest benefits of the
NedGraphics for Adobe® plug-ins is their
ability to seamlessly create intricate fabric
designs within Adobe Illustrator® and
Photoshop®. Not only that, but also, Carles
Lopez notes that this solution has reduced
their design time by at least 50%. This
outstanding efficiency allows his team to
channel their energies into what they excel at
—creativity and craftsmanship.
Furthermore, Oscar de la Renta utilizes Clo3D, a leading 3D garment simulation software, to combine the
designed fabrics with 3D garments. This innovative pairing gives a vivid and tangible representation of their
creative vision, ultimately diminishing the need for physical prototypes.

Another significant advantage of the NedGraphics for Adobe® plug-ins is their capacity to streamline
communication with suppliers. Oscar de la Renta Barcelona can relay all essential details regarding
construction, color, and size to their suppliers in one communication. This newfound efficiency has put an
end to the constant back-and-forth that previously interrupted the creative flow. Carles Lopez is delighted
with the clear, precise, and timely collaboration they now have with their vendors.

Beyond the software, Carles Lopez expresses immense satisfaction with the support provided by
NedGraphics. He appreciates the professional training and online assistance that empower his team to
maximize the utility of these pioneering tools.




In wrapping up, Carles Lopez is not just a fan but a strong advocate for NedGraphics for Adobe®. The
successful implementation of the plug-ins at Oscar de la Renta Barcelona stands as a testament to their
role as a catalyst for productive and creative collaboration. The time saved, the reduced expenses, and the
enhanced communication with suppliers affirm these tools as an indispensable asset to the fashion
industry.

Carles Lopez recommends the NedGraphics for Adobe® plug-ins to fashion professionals looking to push
the boundaries of design. These tools are a perfect blend of innovation and elegance, creativity and
efficiency. The success of Oscar de la Renta Barcelona is a clear indicator of their transformative impact.
