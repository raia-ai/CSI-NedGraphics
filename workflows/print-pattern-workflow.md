# Print & Pattern Workflow

## Design for Photoshop

This workflow comparison demonstrates the significant time savings and efficiency improvements achieved when using NedGraphics Design for Photoshop compared to traditional Photoshop workflows for print and pattern design.

## Table of Contents

The workflow covers five key stages of print pattern design: creating repeats, separations and cleaning, creating colorways, and using templates. Each stage shows a direct comparison between traditional Photoshop methods and NedGraphics Design for Photoshop capabilities, with estimated time requirements for each approach.

## Repeat Creation

### Traditional Photoshop Approach (3-4 Hours)

In traditional Photoshop workflows, artwork is created or purchased and must be put into repeat via stamping out repeats on extended canvas or by using the offset filter. Bounding edges must be resolved manually, which represents the bulk of the time, energy, and creative process required. This manual approach to creating seamless repeats is time-consuming and requires significant technical skill to ensure proper edge alignment.

### NedGraphics Design Approach (1-2 Hours)

With NedGraphics Design for Photoshop, designers can activate straight, half-drop, shift, and custom repeat options based on industry standard repeat sizes. No manual offset is needed, eliminating one of the most time-consuming aspects of traditional repeat creation. Designers can choose from a plethora of tools for building out the bounding edges, and the system provides the ability to build layers while in index mode, which is not an option in standard Photoshop. This streamlined approach reduces repeat creation time by approximately 50-66%.

## Separations & Cleaning

### Traditional Photoshop Approach (2.5 Hours)

The traditional Photoshop separation and cleaning process consists of two main steps. First, the file is indexed as a reduction process, getting ready for cleaning or colorway creation, which takes approximately 30 minutes. Second, cleaning an indexed file with Magic Wand selections, coloring indexed colors over stray pixels or debris, and replacing colors takes approximately 2 hours. Designers can create colorways once finished or manually separate onto layers for screens, but this entire process is labor-intensive and requires careful attention to detail.

### NedGraphics Design Approach (Under 1 Hour)

NedGraphics Design for Photoshop dramatically reduces separation and cleaning time to under one hour total. The separation step takes approximately 15 minutes, during which the file is opened via extension from Photoshop file. Artwork can be indexed before this step, or the designer will manually reduce the artwork into color separations for screens. Separations can be solid colors or blend groups, providing flexibility in output format.

The cleaning step takes 25-45 minutes and allows designers to clean stray pixels using three different cleaning mode options. Colors can be isolated and displayed in black for granular or high-level cleaning, making it easier to identify and correct issues. This represents a time savings of approximately 60% compared to traditional methods.

## Colorways Creation

### Traditional Photoshop Option 1 (1-3 Hours)

The first traditional approach involves creating colorways using the index table. Each colorway must be saved down as a separate file, and color tables must also be saved down or loaded manually in each new file. This process is repetitive and prone to file management errors, particularly when working with multiple colorway variations.

### Traditional Photoshop Option 2 (1-3 Hours)

The second traditional approach involves separating artwork into channels for screen-printing. Colors are converted to spot colors and colorways are made, with colorway files saved separately. This method provides better control over spot color output but still requires significant manual effort and file management.

### NedGraphics Design Approach (20 Minutes)

NedGraphics Design for Photoshop reduces colorway creation to approximately 20 minutes regardless of the number of variations. Color positions are automatically pitched and easily recolored, eliminating manual selection and replacement. Custom palettes automatically load from the Palette Manager tool, ensuring consistency across colorways. The system can auto-recolor blend steps, maintaining smooth gradients across color variations. Most importantly, designers can save unlimited colorway options in one document, eliminating the file management complexity of traditional approaches. This represents a time savings of approximately 80-90% compared to traditional methods.

## Templates

### Traditional Photoshop Approach (1-2 Hours)

In traditional Photoshop workflows, initial presentation layouts can take up to 25 minutes or more to create manually. Each subsequent colorway will need its own sheet, and the original can be used as a template, but this still requires approximately 10 minutes per subsequent colorway. The manual nature of this process makes it time-consuming when preparing multiple colorway presentations.

### NedGraphics Design Approach (5 Minutes)

NedGraphics Design for Photoshop reduces template creation and application to approximately 5 minutes. Templates can be stored and automatically applied to new files, eliminating the need to recreate layouts for each colorway. Colorways are automatically created on the designated template, ensuring consistency across presentations. Adjusting standard templates is quick and easy, with many information options readily available to click on or off. This automation represents a time savings of approximately 75-95% compared to traditional template workflows.

## Workflow Summary

The NedGraphics Design for Photoshop workflow delivers substantial time savings across all stages of print pattern design. Total time for a complete workflow from repeat creation through final templates can be reduced from approximately 8-12 hours using traditional Photoshop methods to approximately 2-3 hours using NedGraphics Design for Photoshop, representing an overall time savings of 70-75%. These efficiency gains allow designers to produce more variations, explore more creative options, and bring products to market faster while maintaining or improving quality standards.
