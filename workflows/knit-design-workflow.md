# Knit Design Workflow

## Knit for Illustrator

This workflow comparison demonstrates the substantial time savings and efficiency improvements achieved when using NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator compared to traditional Adobe Illustrator workflows for knit design, particularly for Fair Isle patterns and other knitted textiles.

## Table of Contents

The workflow covers three key areas: designing Fair Isle patterns, creating colorways, and a bonus feature for converting artwork to knit patterns. Each area shows a direct comparison between traditional Illustrator methods and NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator capabilities, with estimated time requirements and efficiency multipliers for each approach.

## Designing a Fair Isle

### Traditional Illustrator Approach (1.5 Hours or More)

The traditional approach to designing Fair Isle patterns in Adobe Illustrator consists of two labor-intensive steps. First, building stitches takes approximately 30 minutes, during which designers must draw individual knit stitches with the Shape Tool, then copy and paste to build out the design area with single knit stitches. Unique stitches such as purls and laces need to be drawn and copied individually if they are intended to be used in the design. This manual creation of each stitch type is time-consuming and requires careful attention to consistency.

Second, drawing the pattern takes approximately 1 hour, though time will vary depending on the complexity of the design. Designers create a dark background fill, then use the Live Paint Tool to paint stitches into the design. This manual painting process is tedious for complex patterns, and there is no way to accurately depict stitch and row gauge size, requiring additional calculations and adjustments to ensure production accuracy.

### NedGraphics Knit Approach (5 Times Faster: Under 20 Minutes)

NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator reduces Fair Isle design time by a factor of five, completing the entire process in under 20 minutes. Building stitches takes 0 minutes, as designers can begin drawing Fair Isle patterns using ready-made knit stitches from an extensive library. This eliminates the need to manually create and copy stitch shapes, allowing designers to focus on creative pattern development rather than technical construction.

Drawing the pattern takes less than 20 minutes, as designers can choose from three different visual modes: shaded, flat, and color chart. These modes optimize both design and rendering expectations, allowing designers to work in the view that best suits their current task. Designers can change stitch types, gauge size, and view mode with the click of a button to create unique and elevated patterns in minutes. The ability to instantly adjust gauge size ensures that the visual representation accurately reflects production specifications, eliminating manual calculations and reducing errors.

## Creating Colorways

### Traditional Illustrator Approach (Approximately 1 Hour)

Creating colorways in traditional Illustrator workflows takes approximately 1 hour. Designers must trim the artwork to the actual repeat and create a pattern swatch manually. From there, designers need to use the Recolor Tool in Illustrator to create colorways manually, selecting color positions and applying new colors one colorway at a time. This process is repetitive and time-consuming when exploring multiple color options.

### NedGraphics Knit Approach (6 Times Faster: Approximately 10 Minutes)

NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator reduces colorway creation time by a factor of six. Color positions are automatically pitched and easily recolored, eliminating the need for manual selection and trimming. Custom palettes can be easily set using the included Palette Utility tool, ensuring consistency with brand colors or seasonal palettes.

Designers can use Colorist with Templates to create colorway presentations, and the system instantly sends swatches to the color swatch panel to use as fills. This integration streamlines the workflow from colorway creation through presentation to garment application, reducing manual steps and ensuring consistency across all deliverables.

## Bonus Feature: Artwork Converter

### Convert Any Art to Knit Patterns (Under 1 Minute)

NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator includes a powerful bonus feature that allows designers to convert any artwork, whether raster or vector, into either basic or pearl stitches in under 1 minute. This converter tab opens up entirely new creative possibilities that are not available in traditional Illustrator workflows.

Designers can create intricate intarsias by converting photographic or illustrated artwork into knit patterns automatically. They can convert an existing vector stripe design into a knitted version, maintaining the design intent while adapting it to knit construction. The possibilities of what designers can create are endless, as any visual element can be transformed into a knit pattern with appropriate stitch representation.

This feature dramatically expands the creative toolkit available to knit designers, allowing them to leverage existing artwork, photographs, illustrations, and graphic designs as starting points for knit pattern development. The automated conversion process ensures that the resulting knit pattern is technically accurate and production-ready, while the speed of conversion encourages experimentation and exploration of multiple design directions.

## Workflow Summary

The NedGraphics Knit for Illustrator workflow delivers substantial time savings across all stages of knit design. Designing Fair Isle patterns is 5 times faster, creating colorways is 6 times faster, and the bonus artwork converter feature enables entirely new creative possibilities in under 1 minute. These efficiency gains allow designers to explore more design variations, produce more colorways, and experiment with converting diverse artwork into knit patterns while maintaining or improving accuracy and production readiness. The automation of stitch creation, gauge calculations, and colorway generation also reduces errors and ensures that designs are production-ready from the start, eliminating costly revision cycles and accelerating time to market.
