# Woven Design Workflow

## Weave for Illustrator

This workflow comparison demonstrates the dramatic time savings and efficiency improvements achieved when using NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator compared to traditional Adobe Illustrator workflows for woven textile design, particularly for plaids and dobby fabrics.

## Table of Contents

The workflow covers three key stages of woven design: creating plaids, creating colorways, and preparing presentations. Each stage shows a direct comparison between traditional Illustrator methods and NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator capabilities, with estimated time requirements and efficiency multipliers for each approach.

## Creating Plaids

### Traditional Illustrator Approach (1.5 Hours or More)

The traditional approach to creating plaids in Adobe Illustrator consists of two main steps. First, building stripes takes approximately 30 minutes, during which designers build a plaid using Illustrator's Shape Tools and use Transparency and Blend Modes to mimic intersecting stripes. This manual approach requires careful attention to layering and blending to achieve realistic woven appearance.

Second, drawing the weave pattern structure takes approximately 1 hour, though time varies depending on the complexity of the weave. Designers must draw the pattern by hand using Illustrator's Shape tools and grid. This manual drawing process does not accurately depict the pattern scale according to threads per inch, requiring additional adjustments and calculations to ensure production accuracy. Complex weave structures can take significantly longer than one hour to create accurately.

### NedGraphics Weave Approach (9 Times Faster: Under 10 Minutes)

NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator reduces plaid creation time by a factor of nine, completing the entire process in under 10 minutes. Building stripes takes less than 5 minutes using the Weave module to set up Warp and Weft bars for plaid generation. Designers can draw or type exact measurements based on threads per inch or woven pattern repeat size, ensuring production accuracy from the start.

Drawing the weave pattern takes approximately 0-5 minutes, as designers can choose a woven pattern from an extensive list of pre-loaded pattern swatches. For custom patterns, the Draw Pattern tool has already been optimized to scale itself based on the threads per inch input, eliminating manual calculations and adjustments. This automation ensures that the visual representation accurately reflects the production specifications, reducing errors and revision cycles.

## Creating Colorways

### Traditional Illustrator Approach (Approximately 1 Hour)

Creating colorways using Illustrator's Recolor Tool can take up to 10 minutes per colorway, resulting in approximately 1 hour for a typical set of colorway variations. This manual process requires selecting color positions, applying new colors, and verifying that the recoloring has been applied correctly across all pattern elements. Each colorway must be created individually, making the process time-consuming when exploring multiple color options.

### NedGraphics Weave Approach (6 Times Faster: Approximately 10 Minutes)

NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator reduces colorway creation time by a factor of six. Color positions are automatically pitched and easily recolored, eliminating the need for manual selection and verification. Custom palettes can be easily set using the included Palette Utility tool, ensuring consistency with brand colors or seasonal palettes.

Most impressively, random colorways can be easily generated to create hundreds of color combinations using approved colors in a matter of seconds. This capability allows designers to explore far more color options than would be practical with manual methods, increasing creative possibilities while reducing time investment. The automated approach ensures that all color positions are correctly recolored, reducing errors and quality issues.

## Presentations and Pitch Sheets

### Traditional Illustrator Approach (30 Minutes)

Preparing presentations and pitch sheets in traditional Illustrator workflows takes approximately 30 minutes per set. Designers must create pattern swatches of each unique colorway manually, then manually type out all color, document, and technical information for each colorway. This manual data entry is time-consuming and prone to errors, particularly when working with multiple colorways or complex technical specifications.

### NedGraphics Weave Approach (6 Times Faster: 5 Minutes)

NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator reduces presentation preparation time by a factor of six, completing the process in approximately 5 minutes. The Colorist tool automatically creates colorways with pitched color chips, technical weave information, and weave color bar position information using templates. This automation eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistency across all pitch sheets.

The system can present all colorways on their own pitch sheets in a new document, with weave colorway swatches automatically pushed to the swatches panel for easy garment filling. This integration streamlines the workflow from design through presentation to garment application, reducing the number of manual steps and potential error points throughout the process.

## Workflow Summary

The NedGraphics Weave for Illustrator workflow delivers substantial time savings across all stages of woven textile design. Creating plaids is 9 times faster, creating colorways is 6 times faster, and preparing presentations is 6 times faster compared to traditional Adobe Illustrator methods. These efficiency gains allow designers to explore more design variations, produce more colorways, and deliver presentations faster while maintaining or improving accuracy and production readiness. The automation of technical calculations and data entry also reduces errors and ensures that designs are production-ready from the start, eliminating costly revision cycles.
