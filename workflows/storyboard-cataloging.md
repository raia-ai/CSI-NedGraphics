Storyboard and Cataloging is a sophisticated and unique apparel and textile design application for the creation of presentations, storyboards, line sheets, product collections, inspiration boards, color trend sheets and catalog pages. It is an invaluable tool for apparel designers who need to present fabric designs, garment sketches, and color standards with all related merchandising content.
Just about any type of graphic file can be accessed through the use of dedicated file browsers and the content manipulated with simple drag and drop positioning with no limitations on layering,
ordering, and grouping. Once completed, the presentation can be saved. When opened again, all of the objects are still fully editable.
Users can import objects from other software applications, and the program remembers the source.
Double-clicking on the object will automatically launch the source application and any editing that is done will automatically update the presentation.
Storyboard and Cataloging is the most advanced and proven solution available today, with thousands of users worldwide.
