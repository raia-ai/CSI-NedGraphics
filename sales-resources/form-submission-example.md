Dear NedGraphics Team, I am a textile designer working primarily with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I am very interested in learning more about the NedGraphics plug-ins for Adobe, especially the Weave module. My goal is to be able to take designs developed in Illustrator and send them directly to the weaving loom in a proper technical format. Could you please arrange a demo session or provide more information on how the Weave plug-in works, as well as licensing options and trial access?

Greetings [first name/name]
We hope you are doing well.
Thank you for contacting NedGraphics! We appreciate your interest in exploring our solutions, including NedGraphics for Adobe.
NedGraphics for Adobe is seamlessly integrated with your Adobe products. These tools are designed to maximize your creativity and productivity while accelerating your workflow within Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
To see a short clip of the Weave plug-in, please find a YouTube link to view at your convenience.
For your information, this plug-in allows you to create a visual weave and share your designs easily. However, if you need to export technical production information for manufacturing, NedGraphics Easy Weave would be better suited.
May I ask what your available budget is, so we can ensure we provide the best solution for you right from the start?
We hope you find this information helpful. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out - we’re here to help!
Looking forward to hearing from you to assist you further.
Warm regards,
Sabine

Hi [first name/name]
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check in once more regarding your interest in NedGraphics for Adobe.
Many of our clients use the Weave plug-in to:
Visualize fabric designs instantly
Save time by streamlining design workflows in Photoshop & Illustrator
Share concepts quickly and effectively with teams
Before we move forward, I’d love to learn:
What’s the biggest workflow challenge you or your team is facing right now?
Is faster visualization or accurate production data more important for your current projects?
Do you have an available budget and timeline in mind for implementing a solution?
If you’re still exploring options, I’d be glad to share additional resources - such as case studies - or provide more detailed information on how our solutions can support your process.
Would that be helpful for you at this stage?
Thank you again for your interest – I am looking forward to your reply.
Warm regards,
Sabine
