Email 1: General Introduction
Hello [first name],
My name is Sabine, and I’m the SDR at NedGraphics, based in the UK, working alongside my Sales Manager, James McDermott.
At NedGraphics, we offer advanced CAD textile design software that supports every stage of the creative workflow—from concept through to production.
NedGraphics users report:
✅ Increased creativity
✅ At least 50% reduction in design time
✅ Enhanced team collaboration
✅ Greater contribution to sustainability
With our recent NedGraphics 2025 update and integration with Optitex, we’re now even better positioned to equip designers with cutting-edge, sustainable tools.
Brands like Anthropologie and Nordstrom already benefit from NedGraphics, streamlining their design processes and boosting collaboration.
I’d love to schedule a brief discovery call to introduce our solutions and explore how we could support your team’s design workflow.
Looking forward to your thoughts.
Best wishes,
Sabine
Email 1: Personalised Introduction
Hello [First Name],
I’ve been following Lucy & Yak’s impressive journey - growing from a small startup to a brand now generating tens of millions in revenue while keeping bold prints and sustainability at the core.
At NedGraphics, we help innovative apparel companies like yours accelerate their creative workflow and strengthen design differentiation through our CAD textile design software.
With our latest NedGraphics 2025 update, integrated with Optitex, we’re equipping design teams to:
✅ Experiment with prints faster - advanced repeat, colourway, and motif tools cut design time by up to 50%
✅ Enhance collaboration – connect design, product & production in one workflow
✅ Reduce costs & support sustainability - digital sampling minimizes the need for physical swatches
✅ Scale creativity - freeing up time for designers to focus on high-impact, trend-led collections
Given Lucy & Yak’s continued expansion and emphasis on sustainability, I believe our solutions could align closely with your objectives for efficiency, creativity, and greener processes.
Would you be open to a short discovery call next week? I’d be happy to tailor the session around your team’s current workflow and explore where we can add value.
Best regards,
Sabine

Email 4: Follow -up from Email 1: Personalized Introduction
Hi [First Name],
As a final follow-up, I wanted to tie everything back to what makes Lucy & Yak unique — bold prints, in-house creativity, and a strong sustainability ethos. These are exactly the areas NedGraphics has been helping UK apparel brands accelerate:

Recolour artwork effortlessly
Design seamless repeats
Sketch garments with ease
Create woven and knit patterns
Manage and refine colour palettes
All of these tools work directly within Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, helping you save time, boost creativity, and simplify your workflow.
Have a look for yourself – I’ll include a direct link to our YouTube channel where you can see the plugin in action.
If you’d like to explore how this could benefit you or your team, I’d be happy to set up a call or a quick virtual demo.
Warm regards,
