## Toolbar Organization

The Easy Weave interface organizes these toolbars logically to support the woven design workflow. The Standard Toolbar provides file management, the Zoom and Edit toolbars support navigation and modification, the Functions Toolbar controls repeat and symmetry settings, and the Editing Toolbar provides the primary design tools. This organization allows designers to access the tools they need quickly while maintaining a clean workspace that can be customized by hiding or showing toolbars as needed.
