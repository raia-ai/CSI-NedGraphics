EASY KNIT by NedGraphics
Create beautiful knitted designs for sweaters, scarves, golf shirts, socks, sportswear, etc.

Easy Knit provides all of the tools you need to design knit fabrics for sweaters, scarves, golf shirts,
socks, sportswear, and the latest knit trends. Designers can start from scratch with no prerequisite
knowledge of knitted fabric structures.

Easy Knit offers design tools that will allow you to interpret any graphic ﬁle into a knit fabrication of
any density and quality. Once the design is completed you can ﬁnd all the stitch types necessary in
our exclusive visual library to ﬁnd to create realistic knit simulations. Simulations can be colored
instantly and will demonstrate the ﬁnal result.

Work in technical grid format, or even directly in knit simulation view to see the precise stitch
simulated while you change the design. This is especially useful when making complicated cable
and open knit structures. Then, export your ﬁnished knit fabric in standard industry formats that are
compatible with your suppliers manufacturing environments.
Easy Knit Features & Beneﬁts
   •   Create and printout life-size knit garments.
   •   Layering technology allows application of embroideries.
   •   Load and view scans of your actual fabric and use the advanced tracing functions to quickly
       recreate a duplicate virtual sample.
   •   Input designs with precise technical information for gauge density and quality.
   •   Create knits from scratch with various stitches types. Create stripes, or interpret any
       graphic design ﬁle into a knit fabric.
   •   Designs can be viewed as realistic knit simulations, with a large graphic stitch library,
       including cables, front and back stitches, pique, and fancy stitches.
   •   Stitch editor allows users to develop and render their own unique knit stitches.
   •   Apply user deﬁned texturing to enhance realistic knit fabric effects.
   •   Select from existing library or create user deﬁned symbols to represent various stitch types
       for manufacturing.
   •   Export ﬁles in speciﬁc digital formats for communicating with knitting machines.
   •   Manage the number of colors and number of color changes per row with minimum and
       maximum tolerances.
   •   Automatically ﬁnd and correct ﬂoats.
