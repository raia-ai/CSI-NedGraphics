Easy Weave Software
NedGraphics Easy Weave Software offers all of the capabilities required by today’s woven
designers to quickly create beautiful apparel and home furnishings fabrics. No technical weaving
knowledge is necessary to express all of your ideas for striped, plaid, and even more sophisticated
dobby patterned fabrics. Users can select from the included weave library for common weave types
such as, twill, plain weave, satin, oxford, and herringbone.
Custom weave patterns can be entered from scratch, eventually combining several different
weaves in the same design. Yarns of various shades and sizes can be selected to create the warp
and weft color arrangements.
Apply unique fabric texturing and yarn shading, allowing you to print woven simulations that are so
realistic you have to touch the paper to believe it’s not fabric. The simple and intuitive interface
ensures users will be up and running in no time.
Features & Benefits:
