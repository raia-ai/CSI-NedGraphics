# Easy Map Pro Toolbar Reference

NedGraphics Easy Map Pro provides specialized toolbars for color mapping and fabric visualization. This reference documents all available toolbars and their functions for creating realistic product mockups and technical presentations.

## Standard Toolbar

The Standard Toolbar provides essential file management and project operations.

**New** - Click to begin a new color mapping project.

**Open** - Open an already existing Easy Map Pro file for editing.

**Save** - Saves file in current type, preserving all layers and mapping data.

**Print** - Prints your document using current print settings.

**Cut** - Click to remove the image of the active window and copy it to the clipboard.

**Copy** - Click to keep the image of the active window and copy it to the clipboard.

**Paste** - Click to paste the contents of the clipboard into the current project.

**Save Mapped Photo** - Export the current project as an image file, which will not be able to be edited in Easy Map Pro after export.

**Margins and Background** - Create a frame to surround the image for presentation purposes.

**Crop** - Eliminate an outer area of the image to focus on specific regions.

**Scroll** - Click and drag to move the picture in any direction within the workspace.

## Display and Zoom Tools

**Display Mode** - Allows you to switch views to see different elements of the mapping including segments, grids, designs, and shadows.

**Zoom Toolbar** - Allows you to zoom in and out and display more or fewer details of the project.

**Zoomed Life Size** - Show file at real size for accurate scale assessment.

## Grid Tools

The Grid Tools enable precise control over how fabrics are mapped onto product segments.

**Grid Selection** - Allows you to select a particular grid when in grid mode for editing.

**Hermite Grid** - Associate a Hermite grid with current segment. These grids are flexible and can be manipulated in multiple directions for complex surfaces.

**Floor Grid** - Create a floor grid for current segment. Its control points cannot be turned into bending or connecting points, making it suitable for flat surfaces.

**Slave Grid** - Reuse an existing grid that has been defined for another segment, so that many of its settings have already been determined, ensuring consistency.

**Freehand Grid** - Creates a grid and all of its border lines and intersection points from scratch for custom mapping needs.

**Flip Grid** - Reflect current grid on a vertical axis.

**Mirror Grid** - Reflect current grid on a horizontal axis.

**Grid Properties** - Display global overview of all grids present in the project for management and editing.

**Patch Properties** - Opens the patch properties dialog to set the density for each patch, controlling fabric appearance.

**Reference Point** - Modify the coordinates of the reference point, or origin, of the fabric placement.

**View All** - Display all grids. Use the arrow to the right of the icon to view all grids on current layer or on all layers.

**View Segments** - Allows you to view all segments while still working in grid mode for context.

## Mapping Tools

The Mapping Tools control how fabrics and colors are applied to segments and groups.

**View Segments or Groups** - Select whether to view projects as individual segments or organized groups.

**Map Current** - Map the current segment or group with the selected fabric or color.

**Map Selected** - Map all selected segments or groups simultaneously.

**Map All** - Map all segments and groups in the project at once.

## Design Tools

The Design Tools manage fabric and color assignment and placement.

**Assign Fabrics** - Select fabrics to be mapped onto segments or groups from your fabric library.

**Assign Colors** - Select colors to be mapped onto segments or groups from color channels or atlas.

**Mapping Properties** - Customize mapping parameters for each segment or group, including scale and orientation.

**Resize Design** - Adjust the scale of the fabric that has been mapped to achieve the desired appearance.

**Rotation Angle** - Rotate fabric to a chosen angle and click set to update the project.

**Mirror** - Reflect the fabric on a vertical axis.

**Flip** - Reflect the fabric on a horizontal axis.

**Set Placing Point** - Set or modify the mapping origin to control where the fabric pattern begins.

## Undo and Redo Tools

**Undo** - Click to cancel the last modification made to the design during the current session.

**Redo** - Click to cancel the effect of the last undo command, restoring the previous state.

**Undo All** - Click to undo a series of actions, reverting multiple changes at once.

**Redo All** - Click to redo all actions altered in Undo, restoring multiple changes.

## Easy Map Managers

The Manager tools provide comprehensive control over project organization and properties.

**Layers Manager** - Opens the layer properties dialog to modify properties of the various layers in the project.

**Groups Manager** - Sort segments into groups for organized workflow and batch operations.

**Designs Manager** - Used for fabric and color assignment, managing your design library.

**Shadows Manager** - Opens a shadow properties dialog to set the shadow for each segment or group, adding depth and realism.

**Mapping Manager** - Customize mapping parameters across the project for consistent results.

## Edge Smoothing

The Edge Smoothing tools create professional, realistic transitions between mapped segments.

**Edge Size** - Controls the width of the edge around the mapped image that will be smoothed, measured in pixels.

**Smooth Level** - Controls depth of smoothing on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher values creating softer transitions.

**Smooth Edges** - Create blurred margin between segments and their neighbors or the background for realistic appearance.

## Edge Detect

**Width** - Controls the width of detected edges for automatic segment recognition.

**Contrast** - Adjusts the contrast sensitivity for edge detection algorithms.

**Frequency** - Sets the frequency of edge detection sampling for precision control.

## Workflow Integration

Easy Map Pro enables designers to create realistic product visualizations by mapping fabrics and colors onto technical flats, product photos, or 3D renderings. The comprehensive grid system allows precise control over how patterns drape and flow across complex surfaces, while the manager tools provide organized workflow for projects with multiple colorways or fabric options. The edge smoothing capabilities ensure professional, photorealistic results suitable for presentations, catalogs, and e-commerce applications.
