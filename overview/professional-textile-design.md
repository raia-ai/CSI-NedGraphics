## NedGraphics for Adobe for Every Part of the Design Process

### Apparel & Fashion

**Colorist for Illustrator** enables designers to quickly recolor artwork and create endless colorways. Smart functions like randomizer and saved versions facilitate pitching and print preparation, allowing rapid exploration of color options without manual recoloring of individual elements.

**Sketch & Fill for Illustrator** provides tools to draw 2D garments symmetrically, add stitch lines, and fill with color, fabric, or pattern swatches. This functionality is perfect for tech packs and storyboards, enabling efficient communication of design intent to production teams and stakeholders.

**Chip Up Tool** allows designers to pitch out color positions for vector art in a single click, making it ideal for garments, logos, and prints. This tool streamlines the process of creating color callouts and specifications for production documentation.

### Knits & Wovens

**Knit for Illustrator** enables designers to create Fair Isles, intarsias, and custom layouts directly in Illustrator with live knit simulation and easy recoloring. The real-time visualization ensures that designers can see how their patterns will appear in the finished knitted fabric, reducing errors and iterations.

**Weave for Illustrator** provides full control for creating woven constructions like plaids and dobbies. Designers can visualize and recolor designs instantly, exploring different yarn combinations and weave structures without leaving the Illustrator environment.

### Prints & Patterns

**Repeat for Illustrator & Photoshop** facilitates the creation of seamless repeats using straight, drop, and shift layouts. Live preview makes editing a breeze, allowing designers to see how pattern adjustments affect the overall repeat. The tool includes Geo for creating snowflake and geometric motifs, expanding creative possibilities for pattern design.

**Design for Photoshop** enables designers to work in indexed mode while layering, editing, and reducing colors for screen print. The plug-in automates pitch sheets, swatches, and screen separations, streamlining the preparation of files for production and reducing the time required for color separation workflows.

### Color Tools

**Color Utilities for Illustrator** helps teams keep palettes and patterns in sync across distributed design teams. Real-time updates and easy palette sharing with vendors ensure color consistency throughout the design and production process, reducing errors and miscommunication.

**Color Range** provides accurate matching of screen colors to printed results, allowing designers to make color tweaks on the fly right inside Illustrator. This capability bridges the gap between digital design and physical production, ensuring that what designers see on screen closely matches the final printed output.

## Why Choose NedGraphics for Adobe

The integration of NedGraphics tools into Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop represents a strategic approach to textile design software that respects designers' existing workflows while extending their capabilities. Rather than forcing designers to abandon familiar tools and learn entirely new platforms, NedGraphics for Adobe enhances the creative environments they already use daily. This approach reduces training time, maintains productivity during adoption, and allows organizations to leverage their existing Adobe Creative Cloud investments while gaining access to specialized textile design functionality that would otherwise require separate standalone applications.
