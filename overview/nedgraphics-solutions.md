# NedGraphics Desktop Design Solution

NedGraphics Desktop Design Solution encompasses three powerful software modules designed to streamline the textile design workflow from concept to production. These solutions address critical challenges in color management, pattern creation, and design recoloring, enabling designers to work more efficiently while maintaining precise control over their creative output.

## Colour Reduction & Cleaning

NedGraphics Colour Reduction & Cleaning is available in two options: Colour Reduction & Cleaning and Colour Reduction & Cleaning Premium. This specialized print design software excels at processing images and scans, editing and cleaning up image motifs, and reducing colors to a specified number. Separating an unlimited number of colors captured in image scans into a precise number of flat and tonal colors can be a significant challenge, and NedGraphics Colour Reduction & Cleaning simplifies this process by applying color reduction techniques optimized for design type, ensuring designers achieve the desired results in the least amount of time.

### Key Features

The solution offers several distinctive capabilities including the ability to apply masks with Texture Separation, reduce and recolor the most sophisticated tonal techniques, and utilize a unique black and white "film" view that assists with color position controls. The Automatic Repeat and Mirror tool further streamlines the design process.

### Additional Features & Benefits

Designers can import scanned images, digital photographs, or any true color (RGB) file, then reduce and separate the number of colors in a scan to the desired number of colors. Color reduction generates flat colors, textures, tones, and watercolor techniques, while automatic cleaning tools eliminate unnecessary colors and replace them with pre-selected colors. Advanced scan filtering tools such as brightness, contrast, blur, and sharpen are available to refine image quality.

Preview windows display the reduced color image in real time, allowing fine-tuning of color selections. Color selections are saved automatically and can be applied to multiple scans for the processing of large artwork. Most techniques are automatic and can be applied by area or to the entire image, with automatic separations creating and extracting colors from artwork.

The solution can merge multiple scans with sophisticated rotation and alignment tools, while layers allow visualization of the original scan under an image where colors have been reduced to assist in cleaning decisions. Area masking and filtering help address even the most sophisticated designs. Users can print images with color chips and all related color information, taking advantage of advanced print layout capabilities.

## Design & Repeat

NedGraphics Design & Repeat is available in two options: Design & Repeat and Design & Repeat Premium. This advanced CAD fabric design software enables designers to create repeat patterns for any fabric type, whether designing from scratch or editing scanned artwork and fabrics. Users can create designs with a variety of repeated motifs, including complex mirror repeat types, while previewing the finished design and managing repeat patterns with the ability to change repeat type, size, origin point, rescaling, and more.

Design & Repeat by NedGraphics offers an advanced toolset for today's retail, apparel, home furnishings, wallpaper, and textile design companies. Designers can develop new concepts, collections, and coordinating designs by copying motifs, applying textures, and adding stripes, then customize the output to the precise scale and repeat size desired. The solution exports production-ready files in standard formats for simple exchange with customers and manufacturers, and imports and exports files from other CAD and PLM applications, as well as Adobe Creative Cloud.

### Key Features

The split-screen interface enables designing on layers with various object libraries. The IKAT design creation tool provides specialized functionality for this traditional technique. Users can record their design actions and apply them to many files simultaneously, and easily create border designs with dedicated tools.

### Additional Features & Benefits

Designers work using layers to stack various design elements, with support for all varieties of pattern repeats including complex mirroring. The solution manages pattern repeats with curved joins and allows users to open and work between multiple files simultaneously. Designers can visualize any number of interactive zoom views simultaneously and create coordinating patterns by isolating motifs and adding background textures, stripes, and effects.

There are no limitations for drawing over repeat boundaries, ensuring creative freedom. Users can print onto paper or fabric for in-house review, customer presentations, and to replace physical samples, reducing errors by exporting production-ready files. The solution imports and exports layered files with Adobe Photoshop and drives the latest digital printing and engraving machinery. Layering technology supports management of vector objects, including native Adobe Illustrator files.

## Easy Coloring

NedGraphics Easy Coloring is available in two versions: Easy Coloring and Easy Coloring Premium. This solution represents the ideal choice for designers and color industry experts who need to quickly recolor prints, wovens, knits, and graphic files. Easy Coloring automatically matches the desired color standard for virtually any output device and is equipped with an advanced color calibration engine, ensuring color fidelity from monitor to printer to final product.

### Key Features

The solution enables users to create color variations for any fabric including prints, knits, wovens, wall-coverings, and floor-coverings. Designers can view and recolor prints, knits, and woven designs simultaneously, recompose a project based on tonal films, and merge layers or films to optimize production costs.

### Additional Features & Benefits

Easy Coloring creates color variations for any type of design across prints, knits, wovens, wallcoverings, or floorcoverings. The solution automatically saves and manages all color variations in one main file to track and archive creative ideas. Users can input custom color atlases to correspond with seasonal colors, collection colors, color libraries, and color trends, while utilizing color palettes and maximizing the number of colors available on any output device.

Precise color standards match on any printer or monitor without trial and error. Users can print images with color chips and all related information, taking advantage of advanced print layout capabilities. Advanced color calibration engines ensure color fidelity from monitor to printer to final product, while the solution can reconstruct digital engraving separation files for coloring variations.

Full 256 color tones per color are managed by layering technology. The solution simulates resist, dot gain or bleed, overprinting, and platform effects, providing realistic prediction of fall-on colors according to dye types and substrates. Direct spectrophotometer interfaces measure, compare, and match colors, while color calibration matches color across monitors and printers, as well as for paper and digitally printed fabrics. Real-time color gamut indication for related device profiles ensures accurate color representation, and the solution exports color-calibrated files to most industry-specific RIP applications and printer drivers.
